# Patients

## Description

I don't have enough information to provide a specific definition of "patients" in the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods. The term "patients" typically refers to individuals who are receiving medical treatment or care for a specific illness or condition. In the context of contagious diseases, "patients" may refer to individuals who have been diagnosed with a particular disease and are undergoing treatment, isolation, or monitoring to prevent the spread of the disease to others. This could include individuals who have tested positive for a contagious disease and are receiving medical care in hospitals, clinics, or other healthcare facilities, as well as those who are self-isolating at home to prevent further transmission of the disease to others in their community.

In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "patients" may also encompass individuals who are receiving medical care or support through innovative technologies and telemedicine services. This could involve remote monitoring of symptoms, virtual consultations with healthcare providers, and the use of digital health platforms to manage and track the health status of individuals affected by contagious diseases. Additionally, the term "patients" may extend to include vulnerable populations in urban areas who require access to healthcare services, including those living in informal settlements or low-income neighborhoods where access to medical care and resources may be limited. In this context, addressing the needs of "patients" could involve developing sustainable and inclusive healthcare solutions that prioritize equitable access to medical care and support for individuals affected by contagious diseases in urban environments.

The behaviors of patients in green cities are driven by their specific needs, opportunities, and capabilities. Their needs for health and well-being, safety and security, comfort, information and awareness, empowerment and control, as well as sustainable healthcare solutions, motivate them to actively seek medical treatment, care, and support. Patients take advantage of the physical and social opportunities provided by green cities, such as access to green spaces for recreation and stress reduction, improved indoor environments for better health outcomes, and community support networks that address their specific health needs. They also utilize the capabilities of self-care, access to healthcare, mobility, resilience, emotional support, and empowerment, to effectively manage their health, access healthcare services, cope with their conditions, and actively participate in decision-making regarding their healthcare. In summary, the behaviors of patients in green cities are driven by their specific needs, opportunities, and capabilities, as they strive to maintain and improve their health and well-being in a sustainable and supportive environment.

### Needs

By addressing these needs, green cities can create healthcare environments that promote the overall health and satisfaction of patients.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, the opportunities for patients can be categorized into physical and social aspects:

1. Physical opportunities:
   - Access to green spaces: Green cities prioritize the inclusion and preservation of parks, gardens, and other green spaces. Patients can benefit from these areas for recreational activities, stress reduction, and overall well-being.
   - Enhanced indoor environments: Green buildings and neighborhoods often prioritize improved air quality, natural lighting, and thermal comfort. Patients may experience better health outcomes and faster recovery in such environments.
   - Sustainable transportation: Green cities promote eco-friendly transportation options such as cycling lanes, pedestrian-friendly streets, and public transport. This provides patients with convenient access to healthcare facilities.

2. Social opportunities:
   - Community support: Green cities often foster a sense of community and social cohesion. Patients can benefit from support networks, shared resources, and community initiatives that address their specific health needs.
   - Health and wellness programs: Green neighborhoods may offer health and wellness programs specifically tailored to patients. These programs can encompass physical activities, healthy eating initiatives, and educational campaigns that promote disease prevention and management.
   - Collaboration with healthcare providers: Green cities can facilitate collaborations between healthcare providers and community initiatives, leading to improved access to healthcare services, information sharing, and better coordination of care for patients.

Overall, the opportunities for patients in green cities encompass the physical aspects of enhanced environments and access to green spaces, as well as social aspects such as community support and targeted health programs. These opportunities can contribute to the promotion of health, well-being, and resilience among patients living in green building neighborhoods.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, the abilities or capabilities of patients can be categorized into physical and psychological aspects.

This includes having accessible infrastructure, such as ramps or elevators, in buildings and common areas, to ensure that patients with mobility challenges can navigate the environment comfortably.

2. Psychological Abilities:
a) Resilience: Patients in green cities should have the psychological ability to cope with the stress and challenges associated with their contagious diseases. This includes having the resilience to adapt to the changes in their daily routine, follow medical advice, and maintain a positive mindset.
b) Emotional Support: Patients should have access to emotional support networks, such as family, friends, and support groups within their neighborhood. These support systems can provide the psychological strength and encouragement needed to cope with the emotional impact of their illness.
c) Empowerment: Patients should have the psychological capability to actively participate in decision-making processes related to their healthcare. This includes being well-informed about their medical condition, treatment options, and being able to communicate their needs and preferences effectively.
