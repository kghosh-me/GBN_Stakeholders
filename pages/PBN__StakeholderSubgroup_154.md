# Local energy markets

## Description

Local energy markets refer to the decentralized trading and distribution of energy resources within a specific geographical area, such as a neighborhood or community. These markets enable local energy producers, such as homeowners with solar panels or small wind turbines, to sell excess energy to their neighbors or local businesses. This creates a more resilient and sustainable energy system by reducing reliance on centralized power plants and long-distance transmission lines. Additionally, local energy markets can facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid, as they allow for the efficient utilization of locally generated clean energy. By enabling peer-to-peer energy trading and fostering community engagement, local energy markets contribute to the development of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, promoting energy independence and reducing carbon emissions.

Furthermore, local energy markets can support the development of microgrids, which are smaller-scale versions of the traditional electricity grid that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid. This enhances energy security and resilience, particularly in the face of natural disasters or other disruptions. Local energy markets also encourage energy efficiency and demand response programs, as they provide incentives for consumers to adjust their energy usage based on real-time market conditions. Overall, these markets empower communities to take control of their energy supply, promote the adoption of clean energy technologies, and contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy system at the local level.

## NOA

### Overview

Stakeholders in green cities and green building neighborhoods are driven by their automatic and reflective needs, which include cost savings, energy independence, environmental consciousness, community engagement, resilience, and sustainable living. These needs push them to seek opportunities provided by local energy markets, such as energy efficiency, integration of renewable energy, decentralized power generation, and the development of microgrids. Stakeholders have the physical abilities to generate renewable energy, store excess energy, optimize energy usage, and invest in infrastructure. They also have psychological abilities, including awareness, participation, adaptability, and empowerment, which enable them to actively engage in energy-related decision-making, collaborate with others, and innovate. The intersection of stakeholders' needs, the opportunities offered by local energy markets, and their physical and psychological capabilities drives their behaviors towards actively participating in local energy markets, adopting sustainable practices, and contributing to the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy system.

### Needs

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, stakeholders' needs or motivations can be categorized into automatic and reflective needs. 

Automatic needs:

1. Cost savings: Stakeholders may be motivated by the opportunity to save on energy costs by generating their own energy through renewable sources and selling excess energy to their neighbors or local businesses.

2. Energy independence: The desire for energy independence drives stakeholders to reduce their dependence on centralized power plants and long-distance transmission lines. Local energy markets enable them to generate and consume energy locally, enhancing their control over their energy supply.

3. Environmental consciousness: Stakeholders may be motivated by the need to reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to mitigating climate change. Participating in local energy markets allows them to promote renewable energy adoption, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions.

Reflective needs:

1. Community engagement and empowerment: Stakeholders may seek opportunities to actively participate in decision-making processes related to their energy supply. Local energy markets provide a platform for peer-to-peer energy trading and community involvement, fostering a sense of community engagement and empowerment.

2. Resilience and energy security: Stakeholders may have a reflective need for a more resilient energy system. Local energy markets support the development of microgrids, which can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid. This enhances energy security and resilience, particularly in the face of natural disasters or other disruptions.

3. Sustainable and smart living: Stakeholders may aspire to live in a sustainable and smart neighborhood. Local energy markets contribute to the development of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods by promoting the adoption of clean energy technologies, energy efficiency, and demand response programs.

Overall, stakeholders in green cities have needs that revolve around cost savings, energy independence, environmental consciousness, community engagement, resilience, and sustainability. The local energy markets provide them with opportunities to meet these needs and motivations.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or GBN (Green Building Neighborhoods), local energy markets provide several opportunities for both physical and social aspects.

1. Physical Opportunities:
- Energy Efficiency: Local energy markets encourage energy efficiency by incentivizing consumers to adjust their energy usage based on real-time market conditions. This promotes the optimization of energy consumption and reduces wastage.
- Integration of Renewable Energy: These markets facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources into the grid by efficiently utilizing locally generated clean energy. This reduces reliance on fossil fuels and contributes to a greener energy system.
- Decentralized Power Generation: Local energy markets enable decentralized power generation by allowing individual homeowners or businesses with renewable energy systems to sell excess energy to their neighbors or local businesses. This reduces reliance on centralized power plants and long-distance transmission lines and increases the resilience of the energy system.
- Microgrids: Local energy markets can support the development of microgrids, which enhance energy security and resilience. Microgrids, operating independently or in conjunction with the main grid, can provide reliable power during natural disasters or other disruptions.

2. Social Opportunities:
- Community Engagement: Local energy markets foster community engagement by enabling peer-to-peer energy trading. This empowers communities to take control of their energy supply and promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility towards local energy production and consumption.
- Energy Independence: By participating in local energy markets, communities can reduce their dependence on external energy sources. This promotes energy independence and self-sufficiency.
- Social Equity: Local energy markets can contribute to social equity by providing opportunities for homeowners or businesses with renewable energy systems to generate income by selling excess energy. This economic benefit can help in bridging the energy affordability gap.
- Sustainable Development: The development of local energy markets aligns with the goals of sustainable development by reducing carbon emissions and promoting the adoption of clean energy technologies. It contributes to the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy system at the local level.

Overall, local energy markets in green cities or GBN provide physical opportunities for energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, and decentralized power generation. They also offer social opportunities for community engagement, energy independence, social equity, and sustainable development.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities and green building neighborhoods (GBN), the abilities or capabilities of stakeholders, such as residents, businesses, and local authorities, can be defined based on the NOA (Needs, Opportunities, Abilities) framework. 

1. Physical Abilities: 
- Energy Production: Stakeholders in green cities and GBNs have the ability to generate renewable energy through various means, such as solar panels, small wind turbines, or other clean energy technologies.
- Energy Storage: They can also install energy storage systems, such as batteries, to store excess energy for later use, ensuring continuity of energy supply.
- Energy Management: Stakeholders can adopt energy management practices, including smart grid technologies, energy efficiency measures, and demand response programs, to optimize energy usage and reduce waste.
