# Local fitness businesses

## Description

Local fitness businesses refer to establishments that offer health and fitness services within a contained area, typically not exceeding 250 square meters. These businesses play a crucial role in promoting physical activity and well-being within the neighborhood. They provide a range of fitness services, such as gyms, yoga studios, and personal training facilities, that cater to the local community's health and wellness needs. Additionally, local fitness businesses often contribute to the social fabric of the neighborhood by fostering a sense of community and providing opportunities for residents to engage in physical activities that promote a healthy lifestyle.

In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, local fitness businesses are integral to promoting physical activity and well-being while minimizing the need for extensive travel. By offering fitness services within a short distance from residents' homes, these businesses contribute to the concept of the "15-minute city," where essential amenities and services are easily accessible within a 15-minute walking distance. Furthermore, local fitness businesses align with the principles of sustainable urban development by encouraging active transportation, reducing the reliance on motor vehicles, and promoting a healthier and more resilient community.

## NOA

### Overview

The behaviors of local fitness businesses are driven by their inherent needs and motivations, such as financial sustainability, customer satisfaction, and contributing to community well-being. These needs push the businesses to generate revenue, provide quality fitness services, and foster a sense of community. Additionally, reflective needs arise from societal values and aspirations related to green cities and GBNs, leading the businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices, align with the principles of GBNs, and collaborate with other stakeholders. The opportunities available to local fitness businesses, such as integrating with green infrastructure, adopting sustainable building design, promoting community engagement, and collaborating with local stakeholders, further shape their behaviors. Finally, the capabilities of these businesses, including physical infrastructure, access and connectivity, expertise and knowledge, community engagement, and behavior change support, determine how they effectively address their needs and seize the available opportunities in the context of green cities and GBNs.

### Needs

In the context of green cities or Green Building neighborhoods (GBN), the needs or motivations of local fitness businesses can be understood through the NOA framework.

1. Automatic Needs/Motivations: 
Local fitness businesses have automatic needs or motivations that are inherent to their nature and operation. These may include:
- Financial Sustainability: Local fitness businesses need to generate revenue and maintain profitability to sustain their operations in the long term.
- Customer Satisfaction: These businesses need to provide quality fitness services that meet the expectations and needs of their customers.
- Community Well-being: Local fitness businesses have a motivation to contribute to the overall well-being and health of the community they serve.

2. Reflective Needs/Motivations: 
Reflective needs or motivations are influenced by societal values and aspirations related to green cities and GBNs. For local fitness businesses, these may include:
- Environmental Sustainability: The businesses may have a reflective need to minimize their environmental footprint by adopting eco-friendly practices and technologies within their operations.
- Integration with the GBN Concept: Local fitness businesses may have a motivation to align with the principles of GBNs, such as promoting active transportation, reducing carbon emissions, and supporting a healthy and sustainable urban lifestyle.
- Collaboration and Networking: These businesses may feel the need to collaborate with other stakeholders in the GBN, such as local authorities, residents, and sustainability organizations, to collectively enhance the sustainability and well-being of the neighborhood.

Understanding these automatic and reflective needs can help stakeholders, such as city planners, local authorities, and community members, to create an enabling environment that supports and enhances the role of local fitness businesses in green cities and GBNs.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities and green building neighborhoods, local fitness businesses have various physical and social opportunities:

1. Physical Opportunities:
   a. Integration with green infrastructure: Local fitness businesses can be designed and integrated with green infrastructure elements such as green roofs, vertical gardens, or living walls. This not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the business but also contributes to improving air quality, reducing heat island effect, and promoting biodiversity.
   b. Sustainable building design: Local fitness businesses can incorporate sustainable building design principles, including energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems, efficient water management, use of renewable materials, and waste reduction strategies. These opportunities help in reducing their environmental footprint and promoting resource efficiency.

2. Social Opportunities:
   a. Community engagement: Local fitness businesses can serve as gathering places for community members, facilitating social interactions and fostering a sense of belonging. They can organize group fitness classes, wellness events, or workshops that promote healthy lifestyles and bring people together.
   b. Collaboration with local stakeholders: These businesses can collaborate with local community organizations, schools, or healthcare providers to promote fitness and well-being initiatives. They can offer discounted services to vulnerable populations or partner with local schools to provide fitness programs for students.
   c. Knowledge sharing and education: Local fitness businesses have an opportunity to educate residents about the importance of physical activity, healthy living, and sustainable practices. They can organize workshops or seminars on topics like sustainable fitness routines, eco-friendly workout gear, or incorporating sustainable habits into daily life.

Overall, local fitness businesses in green cities have the opportunity to not only provide fitness services but also contribute to the physical and social aspects of sustainable urban development. By embracing green building principles and engaging with the local community, they can promote a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle while enhancing the overall well-being of residents.

Infrastructure and Facilities: Local fitness businesses need to have the physical infrastructure and facilities to offer a range of fitness services such as gyms, yoga studios, and personal training facilities. In the context of green cities or GBNs, these businesses might need to incorporate sustainable design principles, such as energy-efficient equipment, natural lighting, and eco-friendly materials in their facilities.
