# People in high-contamination areas

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "people in high-contamination areas" refers to individuals residing or frequently visiting locations where the risk of disease transmission is significantly elevated. These areas are characterized by high population density, limited access to clean water and sanitation, inadequate ventilation, and often, poor infrastructure. The term encompasses not only residential spaces but also public areas such as markets, transportation hubs, and leisure spots where large numbers of people congregate, increasing the potential for disease spread. Additionally, "people in high-contamination areas" may include those living in informal settlements or peri-urban areas, where overcrowding, lack of access to essential services, and poor living conditions contribute to heightened vulnerability to contagious diseases.

Furthermore, the concept of "people in high-contamination areas" extends beyond physical spaces to encompass individuals working in environments with high transmission risks, such as healthcare facilities, public transportation, and essential services. These individuals may face increased exposure to infectious agents due to the nature of their work and the close proximity to others. The term also encompasses the social and economic factors that contribute to increased susceptibility to disease, including limited access to healthcare, inadequate housing, and poverty. Addressing the challenges faced by people in high-contamination areas requires holistic urban planning and public health strategies that prioritize equitable access to essential services, improved infrastructure, and measures to reduce transmission risks in both public and private spaces.
