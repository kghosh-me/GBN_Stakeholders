# Facility maintenance staff

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, facility maintenance staff refers to the individuals responsible for ensuring the upkeep, cleanliness, and functionality of various built environments. These staff members are crucial in maintaining the hygiene and safety of public spaces, buildings, and facilities to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Their responsibilities may include regular cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces, restocking cleaning supplies, monitoring and maintaining ventilation systems, and ensuring the availability of hand hygiene facilities such as hand sanitizers and handwashing stations. Additionally, facility maintenance staff may be involved in implementing and maintaining touchless technologies to minimize surface contact and reduce the risk of disease transmission. Their role is essential in creating and maintaining healthy and safe built environments that contribute to the prevention and control of contagious diseases within urban and neighborhood settings.

Furthermore, facility maintenance staff play a vital role in implementing design strategies aimed at reducing infection threats in building environments. They work to ensure that the built environment is equipped with the necessary infrastructure and resources to promote public health and safety. This may involve coordinating with other stakeholders to adjust cleaning processes, increase the frequency of cleaning, and implement measures to control the spread of contagious viruses. Facility maintenance staff are integral in the comprehensive effort to create and maintain a healthy and safe urban environment, working in coordination with other engineering disciplines to address the specific needs of different built environments and contribute to the prevention and control of contagious diseases.
