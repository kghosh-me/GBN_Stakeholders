# Environmental agencies

## Description

Environmental agencies are organizations or government bodies that are responsible for overseeing and regulating environmental policies and practices within a specific region or jurisdiction. These agencies are tasked with monitoring and managing the impact of human activities on the natural environment, including air and water quality, waste management, and conservation efforts. They often work to enforce environmental laws and regulations, conduct research on environmental issues, and provide guidance and support to businesses and communities to promote sustainable and eco-friendly practices. Environmental agencies play a crucial role in ensuring that urban and neighborhood development projects adhere to environmental standards and contribute to the overall health and well-being of the community.

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, environmental agencies are essential in addressing the environmental factors that can contribute to the spread of diseases. They work to identify and mitigate environmental risks that may impact public health, such as poor air quality, inadequate sanitation, and overcrowding. By collaborating with other stakeholders, including public health authorities and urban planners, environmental agencies can help develop strategies and policies to create healthier and more resilient urban environments that are better equipped to prevent and respond to contagious diseases. Their involvement in urban development projects can ensure that environmental considerations are integrated into the planning and design process, ultimately contributing to the creation of sustainable and health-promoting communities.
