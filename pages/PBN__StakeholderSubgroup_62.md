# Safe mobility

## Description

Safe mobility refers to the provision of transportation options and infrastructure that prioritize the health and safety of individuals within urban and neighborhood environments. This concept encompasses measures and strategies aimed at minimizing the risk of contagion and the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, while promoting sustainable and efficient modes of transportation. Safe mobility involves creating environments that enable individuals to move around in a manner that reduces the likelihood of exposure to contagious diseases, whether through public transport, walking, cycling, or the use of private vehicles. This includes the implementation of social distancing measures, the promotion of active transport modes, and the adaptation of public transport systems to minimize potential health risks and ensure the safety of passengers.

Furthermore, safe mobility also encompasses the design and management of urban spaces to support the physical and mental well-being of individuals. This includes the creation of safe paths and small roads for walking and micro-mobility, as well as the consideration of ventilation, water access, and sanitation in public spaces. The concept of safe mobility extends beyond the immediate health concerns and encompasses the broader goal of creating sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environments. It involves a holistic approach to urban design and transportation planning that prioritizes the safety, health, and well-being of individuals while also contributing to the long-term sustainability and livability of cities and neighborhoods.
