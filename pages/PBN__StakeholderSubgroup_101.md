# Vehicle users

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "vehicle users" refers to individuals who rely on various modes of transportation for their daily mobility needs. This includes people who use public transport systems such as buses, trains, and subways, as well as those who utilize private vehicles like cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. Vehicle users encompass a wide range of individuals, from commuters traveling to work or school to those running errands or engaging in leisure activities. In the context of contagious diseases, the behavior and choices of vehicle users are crucial as they can impact the spread of infectious diseases within urban environments. For example, vehicle users who opt for active modes of transportation like cycling or walking may contribute to reducing the reliance on public transport, potentially lowering the risk of disease transmission in crowded spaces.

Furthermore, the term "vehicle users" also encompasses the operators and drivers of public transport systems, as well as those responsible for maintaining and managing the infrastructure of transportation networks. These individuals play a significant role in ensuring the safety and well-being of passengers, particularly during times of contagious disease outbreaks. Their actions and adherence to safety protocols, such as implementing social distancing measures, disinfecting vehicles and facilities, and promoting hygiene practices, are essential in mitigating the risk of disease transmission among vehicle users. Additionally, the decisions made by policymakers and urban planners regarding transportation infrastructure and policies directly impact the experiences and behaviors of vehicle users, influencing the overall resilience of urban mobility systems in the face of contagious diseases.
