# Energy communities

## Description

Energy communities are a concept that has gained traction in the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods. These communities are essentially groups of people, organizations, or businesses that come together to collectively manage and share energy resources. The primary goal of energy communities is to promote renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, and sustainable energy practices within a localized area. This can involve the sharing of solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy sources, as well as the implementation of energy-saving technologies and practices. Energy communities often operate on a decentralized model, allowing members to have more control over their energy production and consumption, while also fostering a sense of community and collaboration in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

In the context of contagious diseases, energy communities can play a crucial role in promoting public health and resilience. By prioritizing sustainable energy practices, these communities can contribute to reducing air pollution and environmental degradation, which are known factors that can exacerbate the spread and impact of infectious diseases. Additionally, energy communities can work towards ensuring reliable and sustainable energy sources for healthcare facilities, emergency response systems, and community support services during public health crises. This can help to maintain essential services and infrastructure, while also contributing to the overall health and well-being of the community members. Therefore, energy communities are not only about energy production and consumption, but also about fostering a holistic approach to sustainability and public health within urban and neighborhood settings.

## NOA

### Overview

Energy communities are driven by a range of needs, opportunities, and capabilities that shape their behaviors and actions. Their automatic needs for energy independence, cost savings, and environmental consciousness motivate them to reduce dependency on fossil fuel-based energy sources, manage and share renewable energy resources, and minimize their carbon footprint. The physical opportunities of renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, and green infrastructure empower them to harness sustainable energy sources, improve energy efficiency in buildings and infrastructure, and promote resource efficiency and livability. Social opportunities such as collaboration and knowledge sharing, community engagement, and social cohesion provide a platform for collective learning, innovation, and active participation in decision-making processes. These opportunities foster a sense of ownership, pride, and social interactions among community members. Their physical abilities, such as access to renewable energy resources, energy infrastructure, and energy efficiency measures enable them to implement sustainable energy solutions effectively. Psychological abilities, including awareness and knowledge, collaboration and cooperation, and resilience and adaptability, equip them with the necessary understanding, skills, and mindset to actively participate, cooperate, and adapt to changing energy needs and technologies. Together, these needs, opportunities, and capabilities drive the behaviors of energy communities, leading them to promote renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, and sustainable energy practices, while fostering a sense of community and collaboration in the pursuit of a greener and more resilient future.

### Needs

In the context of green cities, the needs or motivations of energy communities can be defined using the NOA (Needs, Opportunities, Abilities) framework as follows:

1. Automatic Needs:
   a) Energy Independence: Energy communities aim to reduce dependency on traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources and promote the use of renewable energy. This need arises from concerns about energy security, climate change, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   b) Cost Savings: Energy communities seek to reduce energy costs through collective management and sharing of energy resources. By generating and using renewable energy locally, members can potentially save money on their energy bills.
   c) Environmental Consciousness: Energy communities are driven by a need to reduce environmental impact and promote sustainable practices. Members are motivated to minimize their carbon footprint and contribute to overall environmental conservation.

2. Reflective Needs:
   a) Sense of Community: Energy communities foster a sense of belonging and collaboration among members. This need for a tight-knit community arises from the shared goal of sustainable energy practices and a desire to work together towards a common purpose.
   b) Resilience and Adaptability: Energy communities recognize the need to adapt to changing energy demands and potential disruptions in traditional energy systems. They aim to build resilience by diversifying energy sources and creating systems that can withstand shocks and stresses.

Overall, the needs of energy communities in green cities revolve around sustainability, cost-effectiveness, resilience, environmental consciousness, and community building. They seek to address both environmental concerns and the desire for a stronger, more connected community.
