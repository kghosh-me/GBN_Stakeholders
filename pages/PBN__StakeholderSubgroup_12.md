# Park management stakeholders

## Description

Park management stakeholders are individuals, organizations, or groups that have a vested interest in the planning, development, and maintenance of urban green spaces such as parks and public gardens. These stakeholders can include government agencies responsible for urban planning and public works, as well as non-governmental organizations focused on environmental conservation and community engagement. Additionally, park management stakeholders may encompass local residents, community groups, and businesses that utilize or are impacted by the presence of urban green spaces. Their involvement in decision-making processes and resource allocation can significantly influence the design and functionality of parks, as well as the overall well-being of the surrounding neighborhoods.

Furthermore, park management stakeholders play a crucial role in shaping the governance and policy formulation related to urban green spaces. Their input and collaboration are essential for ensuring that parks are effectively integrated into the fabric of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods. By engaging with diverse stakeholders, park management can address public health concerns, promote environmental sustainability, and enhance the social and recreational value of urban green spaces. This collaborative approach can lead to the development of innovative strategies for park management that align with the broader goals of creating healthy, resilient, and inclusive urban environments.

## NOA

### Needs

nIn the context of green cities or Green Building neighborhoods, the needs or motivations of park management stakeholders can be defined using the NOA (Needs, Opportunities, Abilities) framework. The needs of park management stakeholders can be categorized into automatic and reflective needs.

1. Automatic Needs:
   a. Physical Well-being: Park management stakeholders may have an automatic need for access to green spaces for physical exercise, relaxation, and improving their overall well-being. Parks provide opportunities for activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, and various recreational activities.
   b. Health and Environmental Concerns: Stakeholders may also have automatic needs related to health and environmental concerns. They may seek green spaces to improve air quality, mitigate urban heat island effects, reduce noise pollution, and create a healthier and more sustainable living environment.

2. Reflective Needs:
   a. Social Interaction and Community Building: Park management stakeholders may have reflective needs for social interaction, community engagement, and fostering a sense of belonging. Parks provide spaces for residents, community groups, and businesses to come together, organize events, and build stronger social connections.
   b. Engagement and Participation: Stakeholders may have a reflective need for engagement and participation in decision-making processes related to park planning, development, and management. They may seek opportunities to contribute their ideas, opinions, and expertise to ensure that parks meet the diverse needs and preferences of the community.
   c. Environmental Stewardship: Reflective needs may also include a desire for environmental stewardship, conservation, and sustainability. Stakeholders may want parks to incorporate sustainable design features, utilize eco-friendly practices, and support biodiversity conservation.

It is important to note that the needs of park management stakeholders can vary based on individual preferences, cultural backgrounds, and the specific context of the green city or Green Building neighborhood.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or Green Building Neighborhoods (GBNs), park management stakeholders have various opportunities, both physical and social, that arise from the presence and development of urban green spaces. 

1. Physical Opportunities:
- Green Spaces: GBNs provide opportunities for the creation and expansion of green areas, including parks, public gardens, and recreational spaces. Park management stakeholders can utilize these areas to enhance biodiversity, improve air quality, mitigate urban heat island effects, and conserve natural resources.
- Sustainable Infrastructure: GBNs often prioritize sustainable design and infrastructure, such as rainwater harvesting, renewable energy systems, and green buildings. Park management stakeholders can leverage these features to develop eco-friendly park facilities, implement innovative technologies, and integrate sustainable practices in park management.
- Active Transportation: GBNs promote active transportation modes like walking and cycling. Park management stakeholders can capitalize on this emphasis on non-motorized transportation by developing pedestrian and cycling paths that connect green spaces with other parts of the neighborhood. This can encourage physical activity and promote park utilization.

2. Social Opportunities:
- Community Engagement: GBNs emphasize community participation and engagement in decision-making processes. Park management stakeholders have an opportunity to involve local residents, community groups, and businesses in park planning, development, and maintenance. This can foster a sense of ownership, create a shared identity, and strengthen social cohesion among community members.
- Health and Well-being: Urban green spaces in GBNs offer opportunities for physical exercise, recreation, and relaxation. Park management stakeholders can design and manage parks to encourage outdoor activities, promote public health and well-being, and provide spaces for social interactions and community gatherings.
- Education and Awareness: GBNs often emphasize environmental education and awareness. Park management stakeholders can use urban green spaces as educational platforms by organizing workshops, seminars, and events that promote conservation, sustainability, and environmental stewardship. This can contribute to building a knowledgeable and environmentally conscious community.

Overall, the opportunities for park management stakeholders in GBNs lie in the ability to leverage the physical characteristics and social dynamics of these neighborhoods to create and manage green spaces that promote environmental sustainability, community well-being, and inclusive governance.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBNs), the capabilities or abilities of park management stakeholders can be classified into physical and psychological factors.

Physical capabilities refer to the tangible skills, resources, and infrastructure that park management stakeholders possess to contribute to the planning, development, and maintenance of urban green spaces. This includes:

1. Expertise and Knowledge: Stakeholders with expertise in landscape architecture, urban planning, horticulture, and environmental science have the ability to provide technical guidance and ensure the effective design and management of green spaces.

2. Financial Resources: Stakeholders with financial capabilities, such as government agencies, NGOs, or businesses, can allocate funds for park development, maintenance, and improvement.

3. Infrastructure and Equipment: Park management stakeholders with access to necessary tools, equipment, and infrastructure can effectively implement maintenance activities and ensure the functionality of green spaces.

4. Collaboration and Partnerships: Stakeholders that have established working relationships and partnerships with other relevant organizations or groups can leverage collective resources and expertise to enhance park management.

Psychological capabilities of park management stakeholders in GBNs relate to their attitudes, motivations, and behaviors towards green spaces. This includes:

1. Environmental Awareness: Stakeholders with a deep understanding of environmental issues and the benefits of green spaces are more likely to prioritize sustainable park management practices.

2. Social Engagement: Stakeholders who value community involvement and have strong social connections can facilitate participatory decision-making processes and engage local residents in park management initiatives.

3. Adaptability and Resilience: Park management stakeholders who are open to innovative ideas, adapt to changing environmental conditions, and collaborate with various stakeholders are better equipped to address evolving challenges.

4. Advocacy and Influence: Stakeholders with effective communication skills and the ability to influence policy decisions can advocate for sustainable park management practices and secure support from relevant authorities.

5. Empathy and Inclusivity: Stakeholders who prioritize inclusivity and recognize the diverse needs of the community can ensure that urban green spaces are designed and managed to be accessible for all residents, promoting social cohesion.

By considering both the physical and psychological capabilities of park management stakeholders, GBNs can harness the strengths of these stakeholders to develop and maintain sustainable, well-utilized, and enjoyable urban green spaces.
