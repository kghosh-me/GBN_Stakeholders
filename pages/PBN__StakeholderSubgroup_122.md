# International suppliers

## Description

In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, 'international suppliers' refers to companies or entities that provide goods, materials, or services to urban areas from outside the national borders. These suppliers operate on a global scale, often engaging in cross-border trade and commerce to fulfill the needs of urban populations. International suppliers play a crucial role in the supply chain of cities, providing a wide range of products and resources that contribute to the functioning and development of urban infrastructure and services. Their operations are influenced by global economic dynamics, trade agreements, and geopolitical factors, impacting the availability and distribution of essential resources within urban environments.

The concept of international suppliers is closely tied to the interconnectedness of global markets and the flow of goods and services across borders. In the context of contagious diseases, understanding the role of international suppliers becomes essential in assessing the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with the movement of goods and people between different regions. The activities of international suppliers can have implications for public health, as they may contribute to the spread of diseases or influence the availability of medical supplies and resources in urban areas. Therefore, in the context of smart and sustainable cities, managing relationships with international suppliers and ensuring the safety and resilience of supply chains becomes a critical consideration in addressing the challenges posed by contagious diseases within urban environments.
