# General population

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "general population" refers to the entire community residing within a specific urban area. This includes individuals from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, age groups, and cultural or ethnic identities. The general population encompasses residents, workers, and visitors who contribute to the social fabric and economic activities of the urban environment. In the context of contagious diseases, understanding the general population is crucial for developing effective public health strategies, as it involves considering the varied needs, vulnerabilities, and behaviors of the entire community.

Furthermore, the general population in urban settings is characterized by its dynamic nature, with people constantly moving within and between neighborhoods, workplaces, and public spaces. This mobility and interaction within the general population play a significant role in the spread and containment of contagious diseases. As such, addressing the health and well-being of the general population requires a comprehensive approach that considers factors such as access to healthcare, housing conditions, transportation infrastructure, and social support systems. Understanding the general population in the context of contagious diseases is essential for designing interventions and policies that promote health equity, community resilience, and sustainable urban development.

### Needs

nIn the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, the general population's needs can be divided into automatic and reflective needs.

1. Automatic needs:
   - Health and well-being: The general population has an automatic need for a clean and healthy environment. They require access to clean air, safe drinking water, and green spaces for physical activity and relaxation. Green cities can provide these needs through the implementation of sustainable infrastructure and green building practices that prioritize the health and well-being of residents.
   - Energy efficiency and affordability: The general population needs energy-efficient buildings and infrastructure to reduce their energy consumption and lower utility costs. Green cities offer opportunities for energy-efficient housing, smart grids, and renewable energy sources, fulfilling the automatic need for affordable and sustainable energy solutions.
   - Cost-efficient transportation: The general population requires efficient and cost-effective transportation options. Green cities can meet this need through the development of public transit systems, bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and access to electric vehicle charging stations.

2. Reflective needs:
   - Environmental consciousness: The general population recognizes the importance of sustainable practices and has a reflective need to minimize their environmental impact. They desire green cities that promote recycling, waste reduction, and sustainable resource management.
   - Community and social cohesion: Residents desire a sense of belonging and community within green cities. Reflective needs include opportunities for social interactions, community engagement, and active participation in shaping sustainable neighborhoods.
   - Quality of life: The general population has reflective needs for a high quality of life, which includes access to cultural amenities, education, and job opportunities within a sustainable and green urban environment.

The motivations or needs of the general population in green cities revolve around health and well-being, energy efficiency, cost-efficient transportation, environmental consciousness, community cohesion, and an overall high quality of life. Meeting these needs requires strategic urban planning, sustainable infrastructure, and community engagement to ensure a sustainable and inclusive environment.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBN), the general population's opportunities can be defined both in terms of physical and social aspects.

Physical Opportunities:
1. Access to Green Spaces: Green cities offer opportunities for the general population to have increased access to green spaces such as parks, gardens, and urban forests. These spaces provide opportunities for recreation, exercise, relaxation, and improved mental well-being.

2. Sustainable Transportation: Green cities prioritize sustainable transportation options like walking, cycling, and public transportation. This provides opportunities for the general population to reduce their carbon footprint, improve air quality and health, and enhance physical activity.

3. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy: GBNs provide opportunities for the general population to live in energy-efficient buildings powered by renewable energy sources. This lowers energy costs, improves indoor air quality, and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.

4. Access to Sustainable Infrastructure: Green cities focus on developing sustainable infrastructure such as bike lanes, electric vehicle charging stations, and renewable energy grids. This provides opportunities for the general population to adopt and benefit from sustainable lifestyles and technologies.

Social Opportunities:
1. Community Engagement: Green cities encourage community participation and engagement in decision-making processes related to urban planning and development. This allows the general population to have a voice in shaping their neighborhoods and fosters a sense of ownership and belonging.

2. Health and Well-being: GBNs prioritize the health and well-being of their residents. The general population has opportunities to access healthcare facilities, healthy food options, and recreational programs that promote healthy lifestyles.

3. Social Cohesion: Green cities promote social interaction and cohesion among the general population through the design of public spaces, community gardens, and shared facilities. This fosters a sense of community and strengthens social bonds.

4. Education and Awareness: GBNs provide opportunities for the general population to learn about sustainable practices, green technologies, and environmental stewardship. Educational programs and awareness campaigns empower individuals to make informed choices and actively contribute to a greener lifestyle.

Overall, the opportunities in green cities for the general population encompass both physical and social aspects, aiming to create sustainable, healthy, and inclusive communities.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBNs), the abilities or capabilities of the general population can be defined as follows:

1. Physical Abilities: 
- Adaptability: The ability of individuals to adapt to the changing physical environment of GBNs, such as incorporating sustainable transportation methods like cycling or walking, using renewable energy sources, or adopting energy-efficient practices.
- Healthy Living: The ability to engage in physical activities and make lifestyle choices that promote good health, such as utilizing green spaces and parks, participating in community gardening, and taking advantage of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure.
- Access to Amenities: The capability to access and utilize eco-friendly amenities provided in GBNs, including public transportation, renewable energy sources, recycling facilities, and green infrastructure such as rainwater harvesting systems.

2. Psychological Abilities:
- Awareness and Education: The capability to understand and appreciate the importance of sustainable living practices, including energy conservation, waste reduction, and eco-friendly habits, through education, awareness campaigns, and community engagement programs.
- Behavioral Change: The capacity to adopt sustainable behaviors and practices in daily life, such as reducing carbon footprint, conserving water and energy, recycling and waste management, and supporting local and sustainable businesses.
- Resilience: The ability to adapt to the potential challenges and uncertainties associated with living in GBNs, such as changes in infrastructure, policies, and social dynamics, by fostering a sense of community, social cohesion, and collaboration.

It is important to note that the abilities or capabilities of the general population will vary across individuals based on factors such as education, income, age, and cultural background. Addressing these variations and ensuring inclusivity is essential to promote equitable access to green city benefits and enhance the overall capabilities of the general population in GBNs.
