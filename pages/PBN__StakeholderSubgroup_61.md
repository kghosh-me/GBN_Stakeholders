# Soft mobility

## Description

Soft mobility refers to the use of non-motorized and environmentally friendly modes of transportation within urban and neighborhood settings. This includes walking, cycling, and other forms of human-powered transportation that prioritize sustainability, health, and reduced environmental impact. Soft mobility promotes the idea of creating urban spaces that are conducive to pedestrian and cyclist movement, with a focus on safety, accessibility, and comfort. It aims to reduce reliance on private vehicles and promote active modes of transportation, contributing to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. Soft mobility is often integrated into smart city initiatives and sustainable urban planning, emphasizing the importance of creating walkable and bike-friendly neighborhoods that encourage physical activity and reduce carbon emissions.

In the context of contagious diseases, soft mobility becomes particularly relevant as it offers a means of transportation that allows for social distancing and reduces the risk of virus transmission. During pandemics, soft mobility can play a crucial role in maintaining essential mobility while minimizing the potential for virus spread. Additionally, soft mobility aligns with the principles of sustainable and healthy urban living, contributing to the overall resilience of cities and neighborhoods in the face of public health challenges. As cities and communities seek to adapt to the realities of living with contagious diseases, the promotion of soft mobility becomes an integral part of creating smart and sustainable urban environments that prioritize public health and well-being.

### Overview

The behaviors of stakeholders in green cities and sustainable neighborhoods are driven by their needs, opportunities, and capabilities. Stakeholders have automatic needs for convenient and efficient transportation options, which soft mobility satisfies by providing easy access to nearby amenities. They also have a need for improved health and well-being, and soft mobility promotes physical activity and encourages a healthier lifestyle. Safety and security are also needs, and soft mobility, supported by well-designed infrastructure, enhances the safety and security of pedestrians and cyclists. Reflective needs include the desire for environmental sustainability, and soft mobility aligns with this need by reducing carbon emissions. Stakeholders also have a need for community and social connectedness, which soft mobility promotes through social interactions and community engagement. Lastly, stakeholders have a need for an improved quality of life, and soft mobility contributes to a quieter, less polluted, and more pleasant living environment. These needs are supported by physical opportunities such as infrastructure development, public spaces, and proximity of amenities, as well as social opportunities like community engagement, health and well-being initiatives, and environmental awareness. Stakeholders' behaviors are also influenced by their physical and psychological capabilities, including their physical abilities to engage in soft mobility and their psychological abilities in terms of attitudes, beliefs, and awareness of the benefits of soft mobility. Contextual factors like infrastructure availability, safety measures, accessibility, and cultural norms also play a role in shaping stakeholders' behaviors.

### Needs

In the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, the needs or motivations of stakeholders regarding soft mobility can be categorized into automatic and reflective needs. 

1. Automatic Needs:
- Convenience and Efficiency: Stakeholders may have a need for convenient and efficient transportation options within their neighborhoods. Soft mobility provides an opportunity for stakeholders to easily access nearby amenities, services, and facilities without relying on motorized vehicles.
- Health and Well-being: Stakeholders may have a need for improved health and well-being. Soft mobility encourages physical activity, which can contribute to better overall health outcomes and promote a healthier lifestyle.
- Safety and Security: Stakeholders may have a need for safe and secure transportation options. Soft mobility, when supported by well-designed infrastructure and traffic management measures, can enhance the safety and security of pedestrians and cyclists.
  
2. Reflective Needs:
- Environmental Sustainability: Stakeholders may be motivated by the desire to reduce their ecological footprint and contribute to environmental sustainability. Soft mobility aligns with this need by reducing carbon emissions and minimizing the environmental impact of transportation.
- Community and Social Connectedness: Stakeholders may have a need for stronger social connections and a sense of community. Soft mobility promotes a more human-centric urban environment, encouraging social interactions and community engagement among pedestrians and cyclists, leading to a stronger sense of belonging.
- Quality of Life: Stakeholders may have a need for an improved quality of life. Soft mobility can contribute to a quieter, less polluted, and more pleasant living environment, leading to enhanced well-being and a higher overall quality of life.

Addressing these automatic and reflective needs of stakeholders can facilitate the adoption and support of soft mobility within green cities and sustainable neighborhoods. By recognizing and responding to these needs, cities can develop appropriate policies, infrastructure, and services that promote and encourage soft mobility as a viable and attractive transportation option.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities and green building neighborhoods (GBNs), the opportunities for soft mobility can be defined as follows:

1. Physical Opportunities:
- Infrastructure Development: GBNs provide opportunities for the development of well-planned and well-connected walking and cycling infrastructure, including dedicated pedestrian walkways, bicycle lanes, and bike-sharing systems. This infrastructure promotes the use of soft mobility by providing safe and convenient options for residents to walk and cycle within the neighborhood.
- Public Spaces: GBNs can create more public spaces such as parks, green corridors, and pedestrian-friendly zones, which enhance the liveability of the neighborhood and encourage people to engage in walking and cycling activities.
- Proximity of Amenities: By integrating essential amenities such as schools, workplaces, shops, and recreational facilities within the neighborhood, GBNs reduce the need for long-distance travel. This proximity encourages residents to choose soft mobility options for their daily activities, as the destinations are easily accessible on foot or by bicycle.

2. Social Opportunities:
- Community Engagement: GBNs provide opportunities for fostering community engagement and social interaction, as residents are more likely to interact with each other while walking or cycling within the neighborhood. These interactions not only contribute to social cohesion but also reinforce a sense of belonging and livability.
- Health and Well-being: Soft mobility promotes active and healthy lifestyles, offering opportunities for physical exercise and reducing sedentary behavior. GBNs can organize community events and initiatives that promote soft mobility and encourage residents to adopt healthier transportation habits.
- Environmental Awareness: GBNs emphasize sustainability and environmental responsibility. Soft mobility options, such as walking or cycling, have minimal carbon footprints and contribute to reducing air pollution and noise levels in the neighborhood. By promoting soft mobility, GBNs foster an environmentally aware community that values sustainable practices and reduces the overall ecological impact.

By leveraging these physical and social opportunities, GBNs can create an environment that supports and encourages soft mobility, leading to multiple benefits for both individuals and the community as a whole.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, stakeholders' abilities or capabilities refer to their physical and psychological capacities to engage in and benefit from soft mobility practices. 

Physical abilities: This includes the physical capabilities of individuals to actively participate in soft mobility modes such as walking and cycling. It encompasses factors such as individuals' health, fitness levels, physical endurance, and any mobility constraints or disabilities.

Psychological abilities: This refers to the psychological factors that influence stakeholders' willingness and motivation to engage in soft mobility. It includes attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and preferences towards non-motorized transportation options. Psychological abilities also analyze stakeholders' level of awareness and knowledge on the benefits of soft mobility, as well as their perceived susceptibility to the associated health and environmental risks.

Furthermore, stakeholders' abilities or capabilities can also be influenced by other contextual factors such as infrastructure availability, safety measures, accessibility, and cultural norms. For instance, the presence of well-maintained sidewalks, pedestrian-friendly crossings, and well-designed cycling lanes can enhance the physical abilities of individuals for soft mobility. Similarly, the provision of information campaigns, educational programs, and positive social norms can boost the psychological abilities and motivations of stakeholders to adopt and continue soft mobility practices.
