# Communities reliant on the coal and oil industries

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "communities reliant on the coal and oil industries" refers to urban or rural areas whose economic and social structures are heavily dependent on the extraction, production, and consumption of coal and oil. These communities often have a significant portion of their population employed in coal mines, oil refineries, power plants, or related industries. The local economy, infrastructure, and public services are closely tied to the success and stability of these industries. As a result, the health and well-being of residents in these communities are intricately linked to the economic performance and environmental impact of coal and oil activities. The reliance on these industries can shape the physical and social fabric of the community, influencing factors such as air and water quality, access to healthcare, and overall resilience to public health challenges, including contagious diseases.

Furthermore, communities reliant on the coal and oil industries may face unique challenges in the context of contagious diseases. The nature of these industries often involves close physical proximity and shared workspaces, potentially increasing the risk of disease transmission among workers. Additionally, the environmental impact of coal and oil activities, such as air and water pollution, can contribute to underlying health conditions that may exacerbate the effects of contagious diseases. The economic dependence on these industries can also influence the community's ability to adapt to public health crises, affecting access to healthcare, emergency response capabilities, and the overall resilience of the population. As such, understanding the dynamics of these communities is crucial for developing targeted strategies to address public health challenges and promote sustainable and resilient urban development.
