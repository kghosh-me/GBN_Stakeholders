# Political communities

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "political communities" refers to groups of individuals within a specific geographical area who are united by a shared system of governance and political organization. These communities are characterized by their engagement in political processes, decision-making, and the exercise of power within their locality. Political communities encompass a wide range of actors, including elected officials, local government bodies, community leaders, and residents who participate in shaping the policies and regulations that govern the area. They are instrumental in influencing the allocation of resources, the implementation of public health measures, and the coordination of responses to public health emergencies such as contagious diseases. Political communities play a crucial role in determining the distribution of healthcare services, the enforcement of public health regulations, and the mobilization of resources to address health challenges within their jurisdiction.

Furthermore, political communities are essential in fostering collaboration and collective action to address public health issues. They provide a platform for dialogue, advocacy, and the formulation of policies that aim to protect the health and well-being of their members. These communities are responsible for creating an environment that supports public health initiatives, promotes awareness of contagious diseases, and ensures equitable access to healthcare resources. Additionally, political communities are instrumental in establishing partnerships with public health authorities, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to develop and implement strategies for disease prevention, surveillance, and response. Their engagement in decision-making processes and their ability to represent the diverse needs and concerns of their constituents are vital in creating resilient and adaptive systems that can effectively address the challenges posed by contagious diseases in urban and neighborhood settings.

### Overview

The behaviors of political communities in the context of green cities and neighborhoods are driven by their specific needs, opportunities, and capabilities. Their automatic needs for clean and healthy environments, reduction of pollution, and preservation of natural resources motivate them to advocate for sustainable practices. Their reflective needs, such as desires for renewable energy sources, social equity, and accessibility, drive them to pursue sustainable infrastructure and inclusive urban planning. The physical opportunities they have, such as investing in sustainable infrastructure and promoting resource conservation, enable them to create a more sustainable living environment. Social opportunities, such as community engagement and education, provide platforms for residents to actively participate in decision-making and promote sustainable practices. Finally, their physical and psychological capabilities, including knowledge and expertise, technical skills, collaborative networks, financial resources, awareness, leadership, advocacy, and adaptive capacity, empower them to effectively implement and advocate for green initiatives. Overall, the behaviors of political communities are shaped by their specific needs, the opportunities available to them, and the capabilities they possess.

### Needs

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, political communities have both automatic and reflective needs or motivations. 

Automatic needs refer to the immediate and instinctive desires that individuals within political communities may have. These needs include access to clean and healthy environments, reduction of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and preservation of natural resources. Political communities recognize the importance of sustainable practices to ensure a better quality of life and well-being for their residents. They understand that green cities can improve air and water quality, enhance biodiversity, and provide spaces for physical activity and recreation. 

Reflective needs, on the other hand, encompass the more thoughtful and conscious motivations of political communities in the context of green cities. These needs include the desire for a sustainable and resilient urban infrastructure, the promotion of renewable energy sources, and the creation of eco-friendly transportation systems. Reflective needs also involve concerns about social equity, affordable housing, and access to green spaces for all residents, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Political communities recognize the importance of integrating sustainability principles into urban planning and development to create livable and inclusive neighborhoods.

In summary, the needs or motivations of political communities in the context of green cities involve both automatic desires for clean and healthy environments and reflective aspirations for sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy, social equity, and accessibility.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBNs), the opportunities for political communities can be classified into physical and social dimensions.

1. Physical opportunities: 
a) Infrastructure development: GBNs often provide an opportunity for political communities to invest in sustainable infrastructure, such as energy-efficient buildings, renewable energy systems, waste management infrastructure, and green spaces. These physical elements create a more sustainable and healthier living environment for the community.
b) Resource conservation: GBNs emphasize resource efficiency and sustainable practices. Political communities can capitalize on these opportunities by promoting water conservation, efficient transportation systems, green building design, and the use of renewable energy sources. These initiatives not only reduce environmental impact but also contribute to the overall well-being and quality of life for residents.
c) Access to green spaces: GBNs typically include ample green spaces, parks, and recreational areas. These spaces provide opportunities for physical activity, social interaction, and community engagement. Political communities can leverage these opportunities to promote health and well-being, organize community events, and foster a sense of belonging and civic pride.

2. Social opportunities:
a) Community engagement: GBNs offer platforms and opportunities for community members to actively participate in decision-making processes, shape policies, and contribute to the overall development and management of their neighborhood. Political communities can facilitate community engagement through participatory planning methods, public consultations, and involving residents in the design and implementation of green initiatives and projects.
b) Education and awareness: GBNs provide an ideal setting for raising awareness about sustainable practices and promoting environmental literacy. Political communities can seize these opportunities to organize educational campaigns, workshops, and training programs to empower residents with knowledge and skills related to green living, energy conservation, waste management, and sustainable mobility.
c) Collaboration and social cohesion: GBNs foster a sense of community and social cohesion among residents. Political communities can harness these opportunities by promoting social initiatives, organizing community events, and encouraging collaboration among different stakeholders. They can facilitate the formation of community groups, neighborhood associations, and initiatives for collective action towards a greener and more sustainable neighborhood.

Overall, the opportunities for political communities in the context of green cities or GBNs lie in the ability to create a sustainable and healthy living environment, promote community engagement, raise awareness, and foster social cohesion and collaboration among residents.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities (GBNs), the abilities or capabilities of political communities can be defined in terms of both physical and psychological aspects. Here's how these capabilities can be understood within the framework of the NOA (Needs, Opportunities, Abilities) model:

1. Physical abilities: These refer to the tangible resources, infrastructure, and skills that political communities possess to support the development and sustainability of green cities. Some examples include:

- Knowledge and expertise: Political communities need to have access to information and knowledge about green building practices, sustainable technologies, and environmental conservation. This knowledge enables them to make informed decisions, promote sustainable practices, and effectively engage in dialogue with stakeholders.

- Technical skills: Political communities require individuals with technical expertise in areas such as urban planning, architecture, engineering, and renewable energy systems. These skills are vital for designing and implementing sustainable infrastructure, energy-efficient buildings, and transportation systems that reduce carbon emissions.

- Collaborative networks: Political communities can leverage their ability to form partnerships and collaborative networks with key stakeholders. These partnerships may include local businesses, universities, research institutions, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies. Collaborative networks facilitate the exchange of knowledge, resources, and funding to support the implementation of green initiatives.

- Financial resources: Political communities need access to financial resources to invest in sustainable infrastructure, green building projects, and renewable energy systems. This may involve securing funding through grants, subsidies, public-private partnerships, or innovative financing mechanisms.

2. Psychological abilities: These refer to the mindset, attitudes, and behaviors of political communities that enable them to embrace and advocate for green cities. Some examples include:

- Awareness and motivation: Political communities need to be aware of the environmental challenges faced by cities and the benefits of adopting sustainable practices. They should be motivated to tackle climate change, reduce pollution, and enhance the overall quality of life for their residents through the implementation of green initiatives.

- Leadership and participation: Political communities require individuals who are willing to take leadership roles and actively participate in decision-making processes related to sustainability. They should be able to engage residents, businesses, and other stakeholders in discussions, consultations, and public forums to gather input and foster collaboration.

- Advocacy and communication skills: Political communities should have effective advocacy and communication skills to promote the advantages of green cities and influence policy development. This includes communicating the economic, social, and health benefits of sustainable practices to gain support from residents, policymakers, and investors.

- Adaptive capacity: Political communities should possess the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and emerging technologies. They should be open to innovation, willing to learn from best practices, and ready to adjust their strategies as new opportunities and challenges arise in green city development.

By leveraging these physical and psychological abilities, political communities can effectively contribute to the creation and advancement of green cities, which prioritize environmentally-friendly practices and promote long-term sustainability.
