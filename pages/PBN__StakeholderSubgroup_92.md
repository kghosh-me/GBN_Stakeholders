# Real estate agents

## Description

Real estate agents are professionals who act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of real estate properties. They are licensed individuals who are knowledgeable about the real estate market and are responsible for facilitating the sale, purchase, or rental of properties. Real estate agents work closely with clients to understand their needs and preferences, and then use their expertise to identify suitable properties that meet those requirements. They play a crucial role in guiding clients through the complex process of real estate transactions, providing advice on pricing, negotiating deals, and ensuring that all legal and financial aspects of the transaction are handled properly. Additionally, real estate agents often have a deep understanding of the local housing market, allowing them to provide valuable insights and recommendations to their clients.

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, real estate agents play a significant role in promoting healthy living environments. They can advise clients on properties that are designed with sustainable and health-conscious features, such as energy-efficient systems, proper ventilation, and access to green spaces. Real estate agents can also contribute to the development of smart and sustainable neighborhoods by promoting properties that are located in areas with efficient public transportation, walkable streets, and access to essential amenities. By understanding the impact of urban design on public health, real estate agents can guide clients towards properties that contribute to the overall well-being of residents and support the creation of healthier and more resilient communities.

### Needs

nIn the context of green cities or Green Building neighborhoods, real estate agents have various needs or motivations, both automatic and reflective. 

Automatic needs refer to the basic and instinctual desires that real estate agents have in promoting and selling properties in green cities.
