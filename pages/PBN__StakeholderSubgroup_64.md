# International development agencies

## Description

International development agencies are organizations that work to address global challenges related to poverty, inequality, and sustainable development. These agencies are typically funded by governments, international organizations, and private donors, and they work to provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries. Their primary goal is to support the economic, social, and environmental development of these countries, often through initiatives related to healthcare, education, infrastructure, and governance. International development agencies also play a crucial role in disaster response and recovery, working to provide humanitarian aid and support to communities affected by natural disasters, conflicts, and public health emergencies.

These agencies often collaborate with local governments, non-governmental organizations, and community groups to implement programs and projects that aim to improve living conditions, promote economic growth, and build resilience in vulnerable communities. They also work to advocate for policy changes and international cooperation to address global challenges and promote sustainable development. Overall, international development agencies play a vital role in shaping the global development agenda and working towards a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
