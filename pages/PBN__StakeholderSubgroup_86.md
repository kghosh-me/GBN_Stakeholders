# Building maintenance and green building professionals

## Description

Building maintenance and green building professionals are individuals who play a crucial role in ensuring the upkeep and sustainability of buildings within smart and sustainable cities and neighbourhoods. These professionals are responsible for the regular maintenance and repair of buildings, ensuring that they remain in optimal condition to support the health and well-being of their occupants. In the context of contagious diseases, their role becomes even more significant as they are tasked with implementing measures to reduce the risk of transmission within buildings. This may include the installation and maintenance of ventilation systems, ensuring proper air quality, and implementing cleaning and sanitation protocols to minimize the spread of infectious diseases. Additionally, green building professionals focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in building maintenance, such as energy-efficient systems, sustainable materials, and waste reduction, contributing to the overall sustainability of the built environment and its impact on public health.

Furthermore, these professionals are instrumental in the design and implementation of green building initiatives, which aim to create buildings that are not only environmentally friendly but also promote the health and well-being of their occupants. They work towards integrating sustainable practices into building maintenance, such as the use of renewable energy sources, water conservation, and the incorporation of green spaces within urban environments. In the context of contagious diseases, their expertise is essential in developing building designs that prioritize health and safety, including the implementation of technologies and strategies to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. Their work contributes to the creation of resilient and healthy buildings that are better equipped to address the challenges posed by contagious diseases within smart and sustainable cities and neighbourhoods.
