# Individual with high health risks

## Description

An individual with high health risks in the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods can be described as someone who is particularly susceptible to contracting and experiencing severe outcomes from infectious diseases. This susceptibility can be influenced by a variety of factors, including underlying health conditions, compromised immune systems, age, and living conditions. For example, individuals with chronic respiratory conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may be at higher risk due to the potential for respiratory infections to exacerbate their existing health issues. Similarly, older adults and individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those undergoing cancer treatment, may face elevated health risks when exposed to contagious diseases. Moreover, individuals living in densely populated urban areas with inadequate access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare facilities may also be considered to have high health risks due to the increased likelihood of exposure to infectious agents and limited access to medical care.

Furthermore, social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of access to nutritious food, and inadequate housing, can contribute to an individual's vulnerability to contagious diseases. For instance, individuals living in informal settlements or low-income neighborhoods within cities may face heightened health risks due to overcrowded living conditions, limited access to healthcare services, and challenges in practicing preventive measures, like social distancing and frequent handwashing. Therefore, an individual with high health risks in the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods encompasses a broad spectrum of factors that can increase their susceptibility to infectious diseases, necessitating targeted interventions and support to mitigate these risks and promote overall well-being.

This includes specialized care for chronic conditions and timely access to healthcare professionals.

3. Health Education and Awareness: Green cities often facilitate health education programs and campaigns that raise awareness about contagious diseases, preventive measures, and healthy lifestyles. This empowers individuals with high health risks to make informed decisions and adopt behavior changes that can reduce their vulnerability.

Overall, in green cities, individuals with high health risks have physical opportunities for improved air quality, access to green spaces, and efficient waste management. Social opportunities include community engagement, access to healthcare services, and health education initiatives. These opportunities aim to enhance the well-being and resilience of individuals with high health risks in the face of contagious diseases.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBN), individuals with high health risks have both physical and psychological capabilities that can be influenced by their abilities. 

Physical Abilities:
1. Access to healthcare: These individuals should have the ability to access healthcare facilities and services easily within their neighborhood. This includes having hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies nearby, as well as transportation options to reach these facilities when needed.

2. Availability of open spaces: Green cities or GBNs prioritize the presence of open spaces such as parks, gardens, and recreational areas. These areas provide opportunities for physical activity, relaxation, and overall well-being. Individuals with high health risks should have the physical ability and opportunity to engage in these activities, which can promote their physical health and strengthen their immune systems.

3. Adequate housing and living conditions: Individuals with high health risks should have access to safe and adequate housing that is free from environmental hazards. Green cities focus on sustainable housing design and construction, ensuring that the living conditions are conducive to good health, with proper ventilation, natural lighting, and efficient waste management systems.

Psychological Abilities:
1. Awareness and knowledge: Individuals with high health risks should possess the necessary awareness and knowledge about disease prevention, symptoms, and available healthcare resources. This includes understanding the importance of preventive measures like vaccination, regular check-ups, and hygiene practices.

2. Emotional support: Living with high health risks can lead to anxiety, stress, and other psychological challenges. Individuals should have access to psychological support services that address their psychological well-being and help them cope with their conditions.

3. Social connectivity: Green cities often emphasize community engagement and social connectivity.
