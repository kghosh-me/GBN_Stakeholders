# Building managers

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "building managers" refers to professionals responsible for overseeing the operations and maintenance of buildings within urban areas. Building managers play a crucial role in ensuring that the built environment is conducive to public health and well-being, especially in the context of preventing the spread of contagious diseases. They are tasked with implementing strategies and protocols that contribute to the health and safety of occupants, such as ensuring proper ventilation, sanitation, and access to hygiene facilities. Additionally, building managers are responsible for coordinating with health authorities and other stakeholders to develop and implement measures that mitigate the transmission of contagious diseases within the built environment. This may involve the implementation of building automation systems, monitoring indoor air quality, and ensuring that buildings are designed and maintained in a manner that minimizes health risks.

Furthermore, building managers are instrumental in promoting sustainable and resilient urban development in the face of contagious diseases. They are involved in the planning and design of buildings and neighborhoods to create spaces that facilitate public health measures, such as social distancing and access to open, well-ventilated areas. Building managers also work to integrate smart technologies and innovative solutions into the built environment to enhance disease prevention and response. Their role extends beyond the physical infrastructure, encompassing the coordination of community engagement and awareness programs to foster a culture of health and safety within urban areas. Ultimately, building managers are key figures in the pursuit of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods that are resilient to contagious diseases, contributing to the overall well-being of urban populations.

They can also facilitate access to green spaces and promote the use of nature within the built environment, promoting mental and physical health benefits.
- Community Engagement: Building managers can play a crucial role in fostering community engagement and collaboration within GBNs. This can involve organizing workshops, educational programs, and events that promote environmental awareness, sustainable practices, and the building of social relationships among residents.
- Stakeholder Collaboration: Building managers can collaborate with other stakeholders like local authorities, residents, and businesses to develop and implement sustainable initiatives in GBNs. This can involve participatory decision-making processes, partnerships with local businesses for sustainable resource management, and working with city officials to implement policies supporting green living.

Overall, building managers in green cities or GBNs have the opportunity to contribute to sustainable development by implementing energy-efficient practices, promoting renewable energy integration, ensuring health and well-being, fostering community engagement, and collaborating with various stakeholders. This helps create environmentally-friendly, socially inclusive, and resilient neighborhoods.

### Capabilities
