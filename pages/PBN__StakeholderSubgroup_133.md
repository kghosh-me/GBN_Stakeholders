# Citizen researchers

## Description

Citizen researchers are individuals who actively engage in the collection, analysis, and dissemination of data and knowledge related to public health and urban development. These individuals are not necessarily professional researchers or academics, but rather members of the community who are passionate about contributing to the understanding and improvement of their living environment. Citizen researchers often utilize their local knowledge and networks to gather information on various aspects of public health, such as disease spread, environmental quality, and access to healthcare services. They may use a variety of tools and methods, including surveys, interviews, and data collection through digital platforms, to gather and analyze information. By participating in citizen research, these individuals play a crucial role in providing valuable insights and perspectives that may not be captured through traditional research methods, thus contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of public health challenges in urban settings.

Furthermore, citizen researchers often collaborate with local organizations, advocacy groups, and government agencies to share their findings and advocate for evidence-based policies and interventions. Their work can help bridge the gap between academic research and community needs, ensuring that public health initiatives are informed by the lived experiences and observations of those directly affected by urban health challenges. By empowering citizens to become active participants in the research process, citizen researchers contribute to the democratization of knowledge and the promotion of community-driven solutions to public health issues in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods.
