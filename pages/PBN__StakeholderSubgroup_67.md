# Visitors to green spaces

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "visitors to green spaces" refers to individuals who frequent natural or urban green areas for recreational, social, or health-related purposes. These visitors may include people seeking physical exercise, relaxation, or a connection with nature, as well as those looking for opportunities to engage in outdoor activities. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, visitors to green spaces may also encompass individuals who are utilizing these areas as a means of maintaining mental well-being and social distancing, given the restrictions on indoor activities and the need for open-air environments. These visitors could be residents of the city or neighborhood, as well as individuals from surrounding areas who are drawn to the green spaces for various reasons, such as the desire for fresh air, natural beauty, or a break from urban congestion.

Moreover, visitors to green spaces may represent a diverse demographic, including families, individuals, and groups, each with their own motivations for seeking out these areas. The term encompasses people of all ages and backgrounds, highlighting the inclusive nature of green spaces as places that cater to a wide range of needs and preferences. In the context of urban planning and design, understanding the behaviors and needs of visitors to green spaces is crucial for creating sustainable and resilient cities. This understanding can inform the development of green infrastructure that is accessible, well-maintained, and capable of supporting the physical and mental well-being of the population, especially during times of public health crises.

## NOA

### Needs

nIn the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBNs), the needs or motivations of visitors to green spaces can be understood using the NOA (Needs, Opportunities, Abilities) framework.

Automatic Needs:
1. Physical well-being: Visitors may have a need for physical exercise and outdoor activities to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Green spaces provide opportunities for activities like walking, jogging, cycling, or playing sports.
2. Relaxation and stress relief: Green spaces offer a serene and natural environment that can help visitors relax, reduce stress, and improve their mental well-being.
3. Connection with nature: Many people have an innate need to connect with nature. Being in green spaces provides them with a sense of tranquility, beauty, and rejuvenation.
4. Break from urban congestion: Green spaces offer a respite from the busy and crowded urban areas, providing visitors with a chance to escape the noise and pollution of the city.

Reflective Needs:
1. Social interaction: Visitors may have a need for social interaction and community engagement. Green spaces can act as gathering places for people to meet friends, neighbors, and fellow community members.
2. Environmental consciousness: Individuals with a reflective need for environmental sustainability may be motivated to visit green spaces to support and appreciate their ecological value. They may seek opportunities to learn about and contribute to conservation efforts.
3. Mental well-being: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, visitors may have a reflective need to maintain mental well-being and cope with social distancing restrictions. Green spaces allow for outdoor recreation while minimizing the risk of overcrowding.

In summary, the needs or motivations of visitors to green spaces in green cities or GBNs encompass physical well-being, relaxation, connection with nature, escape from urban congestion, social interaction, environmental consciousness, and maintaining mental well-being. Understanding these needs is crucial for designing and managing green spaces that cater to the diverse requirements and preferences of visitors.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBN), visitors to green spaces have various opportunities both physically and socially. 

Physical Opportunities:
1. Accessible green spaces: GBNs provide the opportunity for visitors to have easy access to well-designed and well-maintained green spaces. These areas can include parks, gardens, urban forests, and green rooftops. The proximity of these green spaces to residential areas ensures that they are easily accessible for visitors, promoting physical exercise, relaxation, and connection with nature.

2. Health and well-being benefits: Green spaces in GBNs offer opportunities for visitors to improve their physical and mental health. These spaces provide an environment for activities such as walking, jogging, cycling, and outdoor sports. The presence of greenery, trees, and natural elements in these areas can also have a positive impact on air quality, reducing pollution and promoting better respiratory health.

Social Opportunities:
1. Community interaction: Green spaces in GBNs act as gathering places for residents and visitors, facilitating social interactions and community bonding. People of different ages and backgrounds can come together in these areas for picnics, social events, or simply to enjoy shared spaces. This helps foster a sense of belonging and social cohesion within the community.

2. Recreational and cultural activities: Green spaces in GBNs provide opportunities for various recreational and cultural activities, including concerts, festivals, art installations, and outdoor exhibitions. These events bring people together, promote local culture and creativity, and enhance the overall social atmosphere in the neighborhood.

3. Education and awareness: Green spaces can be used as platforms to educate visitors about environmental sustainability, biodiversity, and ecological conservation. Interpretive signage, educational programs, and guided tours can inform visitors about the importance of maintaining and preserving green spaces, promoting a sense of civic responsibility.

Overall, visitors to green spaces in GBNs have the physical opportunity to engage in outdoor activities, improve their health, and connect with nature. Socially, these spaces offer opportunities for community interaction, recreational activities, cultural events, and environmental education.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, the abilities or capabilities of visitors to green spaces can be understood in terms of their physical and psychological capacities. 

Physical abilities refer to the physical attributes and skills of individuals to engage in activities within green spaces. This includes their motor skills, physical fitness, and overall health. Physical abilities enable individuals to participate in recreational activities, such as walking, jogging, cycling, or playing sports in green spaces. It also encompasses their ability to navigate and access different areas within the green spaces, such as using trails, accessing picnic areas, or utilizing playgrounds.

Psychological abilities, on the other hand, focus on the mental and emotional capacities of individuals to engage with green spaces. This includes their cognitive functions, emotional well-being, and sensory perception. Psychological abilities are essential for individuals to connect with nature, derive relaxation, and experience mental well-being in green spaces. These abilities enable individuals to find solace, reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance their overall quality of life through the beneficial effects of being in a natural environment.

The capabilities of visitors to green spaces are influenced by various factors, including their age, health condition, mobility, and personal preferences. For instance, younger individuals may have higher physical abilities, allowing them to engage in more strenuous activities, while older individuals may have specific limitations that require green spaces with adequate amenities and accessibility features.

Considering the NOA framework, understanding the abilities of visitors to green spaces in green cities is crucial for designing and managing these areas effectively. It helps ensure that the infrastructure and facilities within green spaces are inclusive, accommodating the diverse capabilities of individuals. Creating accessible pathways, providing seating areas, installing ramps or lifts for individuals with mobility challenges, and incorporating sensory elements are examples of design interventions that can support the physical and psychological capabilities of visitors to green spaces in green cities.
