# Fragile and/or isolated population

## Description

A "fragile and/or isolated population" refers to a group of individuals who are particularly vulnerable to the spread and impact of contagious diseases due to various social, economic, and environmental factors. These populations often reside in informal urban settlements, slums, or low-income neighborhoods with limited access to basic infrastructure and healthcare services. The term "fragile" encompasses the susceptibility of these communities to the adverse effects of infectious diseases, often due to inadequate housing, poor sanitation, and lack of clean water. Additionally, these populations may face systemic vulnerabilities, such as overlapping health conditions, social concerns like violence and persecution, and natural factors like floods and heat, which further exacerbate their susceptibility to contagious diseases. The isolation of these populations can stem from their limited mobility, restricted access to information, and challenges in seeking medical care, making them more susceptible to the rapid transmission of diseases within their communities.

Furthermore, the fragility and isolation of these populations are often compounded by their limited access to resources and support systems, which can hinder their ability to adopt preventive measures and access timely medical interventions. In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, addressing the needs of these fragile and isolated populations is crucial for effective public health management. It requires targeted interventions that consider the unique challenges faced by these communities, including the provision of adequate healthcare infrastructure, improved access to clean water and sanitation, and community-based outreach programs to enhance awareness and promote preventive measures. Moreover, integrating these populations into the broader urban planning and development strategies is essential to ensure that their specific vulnerabilities are addressed, and they are not left behind in the pursuit of smart and sustainable urban environments.

## NOA

### Overview

The behaviors of fragile and isolated populations are driven by a combination of their needs, opportunities, and capabilities. Their automatic needs for physical safety, adequate housing, basic infrastructure, and healthcare services motivate them to seek out green cities and building neighborhoods that provide these essential amenities. The reflective needs for social inclusion, education and awareness, and economic opportunities further influence their behaviors, as they actively engage in community activities, adopt sustainable practices, and strive for economic empowerment. The opportunities provided by green cities, such as improved infrastructure, enhanced public spaces, and proximity to services, enable them to fulfill their needs and engage in positive behaviors. Additionally, the social opportunities presented by community engagement, capacity building, and social support networks empower them and contribute to their overall well-being. Their physical abilities, including access to basic services, mobility, and resilience to natural factors, impact their behaviors by influencing their ability to navigate and contribute to green cities. Their psychological abilities, such as empowerment and awareness, social cohesion, and psychological resilience, further shape their behaviors as they actively participate in decision-making processes, build social connections, and cope with challenges. Overall, their behaviors are driven by a complex interplay between their needs, opportunities, and capabilities, as they strive for a safer, healthier, and more inclusive living environment within green cities and building neighborhoods.

### Needs

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, the needs or motivations of fragile and isolated populations can be categorized into automatic and reflective needs.

1. Automatic Needs:
   - Physical Safety: Fragile and isolated populations require safe and secure housing conditions that protect them from environmental hazards, such as extreme heat or flooding. Green buildings and neighborhoods must prioritize design and construction strategies that ensure the safety and resilience of these communities.
   - Adequate Housing: These populations need access to affordable and decent housing that meets their basic needs, provides proper ventilation, insulation, and access to clean water and sanitation facilities.
   - Basic Infrastructure: Access to basic infrastructure, including reliable electricity, clean water, and waste management systems, is essential for the well-being and health of these populations.
   - Healthcare Services: Fragile populations require accessible and affordable healthcare services within their neighborhoods. Integrating healthcare facilities or mobile clinics in green building neighborhoods can ensure their access to primary care and preventive measures.

2. Reflective Needs:
   - Social Inclusion: Fragile and isolated populations have a reflective need for social inclusion and meaningful participation in their communities. They require opportunities to have a voice in decision-making processes related to urban planning and development. Creating platforms for community engagement and involving these populations in the design and implementation of green building neighborhoods can meet this need.
   - Education and Awareness: Providing education and awareness programs on sustainable living practices, hygiene, and preventive measures against contagious diseases can empower these populations and help them adopt sustainable behaviors.
   - Economic Opportunities: Fragile populations often face economic challenges. Providing skill development and job opportunities within the green building sector can address their reflective need for economic empowerment and improve their overall well-being.

Addressing these automatic and reflective needs paves the way for a more inclusive and resilient green city or green building neighborhood that values the well-being and participation of its most vulnerable populations.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, fragile and isolated populations face unique challenges and have limited access to resources. However, there are also opportunities that can be harnessed to improve their situation. 

1. Physical Opportunities:
- Access to Improved Infrastructure: Green cities and neighborhoods often prioritize sustainable infrastructure, including efficient housing, renewable energy, and waste management systems. These physical improvements can provide better living conditions for fragile and isolated populations, addressing issues related to inadequate housing, sanitation, and access to clean water.
- Enhanced Public Spaces: Green cities often include well-designed public spaces that promote social interaction, physical activity, and community engagement. These spaces can provide opportunities for fragile and isolated populations to connect with other community members, reducing their social isolation and fostering a sense of belonging.
- Proximity to Services: Green building neighborhoods are designed to be compact and walkable, with mixed-use developments that integrate residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. This can reduce the physical distance between services and facilities, making it easier for fragile and isolated populations to access healthcare, education, employment, and social support.

2. Social Opportunities:
- Community Engagement: Green cities prioritize community engagement and participation in decision-making processes. This provides an opportunity for fragile and isolated populations to have a voice in shaping their neighborhoods and advocating for their specific needs.
- Capacity Building: Green cities often prioritize education and capacity-building programs to promote sustainable practices and encourage active citizenship. These programs can empower fragile and isolated populations by providing them with knowledge and skills necessary to engage in sustainable behavior and actively participate in their communities.
- Social Support Networks: Green cities can facilitate the establishment of social support networks and community-based organizations that work towards the well-being of vulnerable populations. These networks can provide emotional support, access to resources, and opportunities for collaboration and collective action.

Overall, while fragile and isolated populations may face significant challenges in green cities, the opportunities provided through improved infrastructure, enhanced public spaces, proximity to services, community engagement, capacity building, and social support networks can serve as a foundation for their empowerment and inclusion in sustainable urban environments.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, the abilities or capabilities of the fragile and isolated population can be evaluated from both physical and psychological perspectives. Here's how their abilities can be defined within the NOA framework:

1. Physical Abilities:
   - Access to Basic Services: The physical capabilities of these populations may be limited due to their lack of access to basic services like healthcare, clean water, sanitation, and transportation. Improving their physical abilities would involve ensuring the availability of these services within or near their neighborhoods.
   - Mobility: Limited mobility can hinder their ability to access healthcare services, employment opportunities, and community resources. Enhancing their physical abilities would involve improving transportation infrastructure, creating walkable neighborhoods, and providing accessible public spaces within the green building neighborhoods.
   - Resilience to Natural Factors: Fragile populations residing in vulnerable areas may lack the physical capabilities to withstand natural disasters or extreme weather events. Enhancing their abilities would involve incorporating resilient infrastructure, such as flood-resistant buildings and efficient climate control systems, to ensure their safety and well-being.

2. Psychological Abilities:
   - Empowerment and Awareness: Fragile and isolated populations may lack awareness of preventive measures and their rights. Enhancing their psychological abilities would involve empowering them with knowledge, raising awareness about health and safety practices, and ensuring their active participation in decision-making processes related to their living environment.
   - Social Cohesion: Psychological well-being is closely linked to social connections and community support. Building strong social networks within green building neighborhoods can enhance their psychological abilities by fostering a sense of belonging, trust, and cooperation among community members.
   - Psychological Resilience: The ability to cope with stress, trauma, and adversities is crucial for the well-being of fragile and isolated populations. Implementing community-based programs that provide psychosocial support and counseling services can strengthen their psychological capabilities.

Overall, improving the physical and psychological abilities of the fragile and isolated population in the context of green cities would require a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs, empowers them, and ensures their inclusion in the planning and development processes.
