# Occupants of shared household spaces

## Description

The term "occupants of shared household spaces" refers to individuals or groups of people who reside in a common living environment, such as an apartment building, townhouse, or shared housing complex. These occupants share common areas and facilities within the building, including entrances, hallways, elevators, and communal spaces. The term encompasses a diverse range of individuals, from families and roommates to individuals living in co-living arrangements. In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, understanding the dynamics and behaviors of occupants of shared household spaces is crucial for assessing the risk of disease transmission and implementing effective preventive measures. Factors such as population density, shared facilities, and social interactions within these shared spaces can significantly impact the spread of infectious diseases and the overall health and well-being of the occupants.

Moreover, the occupants of shared household spaces are influenced by various social, economic, and environmental factors that can affect their vulnerability to contagious diseases. For instance, individuals living in densely populated shared housing may face challenges in maintaining physical distancing and practicing proper hygiene, increasing the risk of disease transmission. Additionally, factors such as access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and healthcare services can impact the ability of occupants to protect themselves from infectious diseases. Understanding the unique needs and behaviors of occupants of shared household spaces is essential for developing targeted interventions and design strategies to create healthier and safer living environments in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods.

### Overview

The behaviors of occupants of shared household spaces in green cities and green building neighborhoods are driven by their specific needs, which include both automatic and reflective needs. Their automatic needs for clean air, water, nutritious food, and comfortable living conditions are motivated by a desire for a healthy living environment and reduced exposure to pollutants. Additionally, their reflective needs for a sense of community, social connection, and environmental stewardship drive their motivation to live in a sustainable neighborhood and engage in sustainable behaviors. These needs are then influenced by the opportunities available to them, such as the physical opportunities of energy efficiency, a healthy indoor environment, and access to green spaces, as well as the social opportunities of community engagement, sharing economy, and education and awareness. Lastly, their capabilities, both physical and psychological, enable them to adapt to the changing environments and technologies, effectively manage resources, utilize alternative modes of transportation, be aware of sustainable principles, adopt sustainable behaviors, and collaborate with other residents. Overall, their behaviors are shaped by their needs, which are fulfilled through the opportunities provided to them, and their capabilities allow them to actively contribute to the goals of green cities and green building neighborhoods.

### Needs

In the context of green cities or Green Building neighborhoods (GBNs), the needs of occupants of shared household spaces can be categorized into both automatic and reflective needs.

Automatic needs refer to the basic physiological and psychological requirements that occupants have to fulfill in order to maintain their health and well-being. These needs include access to clean air, water, and nutritious food, as well as comfortable and safe living conditions. In GBNs, occupants may have an increased motivation for these automatic needs, as these neighborhoods often prioritize energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and sustainable food production. The motivation for these needs can stem from a desire for a healthy living environment, reduced exposure to pollutants, and improved overall well-being. Additionally, occupants may also have a motivation for energy conservation and cost savings, as GBNs typically integrate sustainable building practices and technologies, which can contribute to lower utility bills.

Reflective needs, on the other hand, are driven by personal values, social influences, and the desire for self-improvement. In the context of GBNs, reflective needs of occupants may include a sense of community, social connection, and environmental stewardship. These occupants may be motivated by the opportunity to live in a sustainable and environmentally-conscious neighborhood and contribute to reducing their ecological footprint. They may have a desire to engage in sustainable behaviors, such as recycling, energy conservation, and using alternative modes of transportation. The motivation for these reflective needs can also arise from the promotion of social equity and the desire to live in a neighborhood that fosters a sense of belonging and promotes sustainable values.

In summary, the needs or motivations of occupants of shared household spaces in green cities or GBNs encompass both automatic needs related to health and well-being, as well as reflective needs related to sustainable living, community, and social connection. Understanding and addressing these needs are crucial for promoting the adoption of sustainable behaviors and creating a sense of belonging within the shared living environment.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBNs), occupants of shared household spaces have various opportunities, both physical and social, that can contribute to their well-being and the overall sustainability of the community. 

1. Physical Opportunities:
- Energy Efficiency: GBNs often incorporate energy-efficient features such as insulation, solar panels, and smart energy management systems. This provides an opportunity for occupants to reduce their energy consumption and contribute to a more sustainable and cost-effective living environment.
- Healthy Indoor Environment: GBNs prioritize factors such as natural lighting, good air quality, and effective ventilation systems. This can improve the health and well-being of occupants by reducing the risk of respiratory illnesses and promoting overall comfort.
- Access to Green Spaces: Green cities prioritize the inclusion of parks, gardens, and green spaces within the neighborhood. Occupants of shared household spaces can benefit from the availability of these spaces, which provide opportunities for exercise, relaxation, and social interaction in a natural environment.

2. Social Opportunities:
- Community Engagement: GBNs encourage community participation and engagement through shared spaces, such as community gardens, rooftop terraces, or common lounges. This facilitates social interactions among occupants, promoting a sense of belonging and fostering social relationships within the neighborhood.
- Sharing Economy: Shared living spaces often promote the concept of sharing resources and assets, such as shared kitchens, laundry facilities, or common workspaces. This encourages collaboration and reduces the environmental impact by optimizing the use of resources.
- Education and Awareness: Green cities provide educational programs and initiatives to raise awareness about sustainability practices. This can create opportunities for occupants of shared household spaces to learn about eco-friendly behaviors, waste management, and sustainable lifestyle choices.

It is important to note that these opportunities can vary depending on the specific design and implementation of green cities or GBNs. Therefore, understanding the specific context and features of a particular green city is crucial for accurately identifying the opportunities available to occupants of shared household spaces.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, the abilities or capabilities of occupants of shared household spaces can be analyzed in terms of both physical and psychological aspects.

1. Physical Abilities:
a) Adaptability: Occupants of shared household spaces should possess the ability to adapt to the changing environments and technologies present in green cities. This includes being open to utilizing energy-efficient equipment, adjusting to renewable energy sources, and adopting sustainable practices in their daily routines.
b) Resource Management: In green cities, occupants need to have the capability to effectively manage and utilize resources such as water, electricity, and waste. This involves understanding and implementing sustainable practices like water conservation, energy-efficient usage, and recycling.
c) Mobility: Occupants should have the ability to access alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, or using public transport to reduce their carbon footprint. This may require physical capabilities to engage in active transportation options and utilize the available infrastructure.

2. Psychological Abilities:
a) Awareness: Occupants of shared household spaces should have an understanding of the principles and benefits of green cities. This involves being aware of the importance of environmental sustainability, energy conservation, and the impact of their choices on the overall ecosystem.
b) Behavior Change: Psychological abilities include the capacity to adopt environmentally-friendly behaviors and make sustainable choices. This can involve habits such as reducing energy consumption, recycling, minimizing waste, and using eco-friendly products.
c) Collaboration: Occupants should have the ability to collaborate and engage in collective actions with other residents of shared household spaces. This includes participating in community initiatives, sharing resources, and working together to create a sustainable and resilient neighborhood.

Considering the NOA framework, these abilities of occupants provide them with the potential to actively contribute to the green cities' goals, meet the requirements of green building neighborhoods, and participate in sustainability initiatives.
