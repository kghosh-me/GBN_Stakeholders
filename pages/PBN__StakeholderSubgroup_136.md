# Smart city managers

## Description

Smart city managers are professionals who play a crucial role in the development and implementation of smart and sustainable urban initiatives. They are responsible for overseeing the integration of digital tools and technologies into the management and decision-making processes of cities, particularly in response to contagious diseases and public health crises. Smart city managers work to ensure that cities utilize digital tools with the purpose of automating systems and services, emphasizing sustainability, sensing, and collaboration. They are also involved in optimizing resources and precision in the supply of public services, with a focus on urban resilience, adaptability, and government capacity. Additionally, smart city managers are instrumental in fostering effective participation of citizens, government, and private organizations in building smart city solutions, such as smart energy and water systems, intelligent transport systems, and other infrastructure and technology developments aimed at enhancing public health and minimizing economic losses during pandemics.

Furthermore, smart city managers are involved in the coordination of data-driven services and IoT devices, such as surveillance cameras, sensors, and actuators, to deliver community-wide social distancing estimates and early detection of potential pandemics. They work to ensure that smart cities host data-driven services and technologies that enable swift, multipolar, and effective action against acute and sustained public health threats. Smart city managers also collaborate with various stakeholders, including technical experts, public health professionals, and policymakers, to develop and implement strategies that balance conflicting values, such as densification and social distancing, to create urban environments that are both environmentally sustainable and resilient to contagious diseases. Overall, smart city managers are at the forefront of leveraging technology and data to enhance urban health and well-being in the face of public health crises.
