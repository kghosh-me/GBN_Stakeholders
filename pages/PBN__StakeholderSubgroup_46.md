# Physical workers

## Description

In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "physical workers" refers to individuals whose occupations require them to engage in physical labor or manual work. These workers are often involved in tasks that demand physical exertion, such as construction, manufacturing, agriculture, and maintenance. They may be employed in various sectors, including infrastructure development, public services, and industrial production. Physical workers are essential contributors to the functioning and development of urban areas, as they play a crucial role in building and maintaining the built environment, transportation systems, and public amenities. Their work often involves exposure to environmental conditions and occupational hazards, making their health and safety a significant concern in the context of urban planning and management.

In the context of contagious diseases, the term "physical workers" also encompasses individuals who are employed in essential services, such as healthcare, emergency response, and sanitation. These workers are on the front lines of responding to public health crises and maintaining critical infrastructure during pandemics. Their roles may involve direct contact with infected individuals, handling medical waste, or ensuring the cleanliness and sanitation of public spaces. As such, the health and well-being of physical workers are integral to the overall resilience and sustainability of cities, as their ability to carry out their duties impacts the containment and management of contagious diseases within urban environments. Therefore, considerations for the protection and support of physical workers are fundamental in the planning and design of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods.

### Overview

The behaviors of physical workers in green cities are driven by their needs, opportunities, and capabilities. Their automatic needs for stable employment and fair wages motivate them to seek opportunities in the growing green economy. Their reflective needs for skill development and training drive their desire to adapt to changing technologies and practices in the green construction sector. These needs, combined with the physical and social opportunities available to them, such as employment in green industries and collaboration with diverse stakeholders, encourage physical workers to actively engage in the development and maintenance of sustainable urban environments. They leverage their physical abilities, such as strength, stamina, and adaptability, to carry out their tasks effectively. Their psychological abilities, such as resilience, problem-solving skills, and attention to safety, enable them to overcome challenges and ensure the success of sustainable construction practices. Overall, physical workers' behaviors are shaped by their needs, the opportunities available to them, and their capabilities, allowing them to contribute to the creation of green cities and neighborhoods.

### Needs

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, physical workers have various needs or motivations that can be categorized into automatic and reflective needs.

Automatic needs refer to the immediate and tangible requirements that physical workers have in their daily lives. Some of these automatic needs for physical workers in green cities may include:

1. Employment and Economic Stability: Physical workers need opportunities for stable employment and fair wages to support themselves and their families. They require job security and the assurance that their skills are valued in the green economy.

2. Safe and Healthy Working Conditions: Physical workers need safe working environments that protect them from hazards, such as exposure to harmful substances or dangerous equipment. They require access to necessary protective gear and training to minimize risks to their health and safety.

3. Adequate Rest and Recreation: Physical workers require spaces and facilities for rest and recreation within green cities. These may include green spaces, recreational centers, and amenities that promote physical well-being and relaxation after physically demanding work.

Reflective needs relate to the long-term aspirations and values of physical workers. Some reflective needs for physical workers in green cities may include:

1. Skill Development and Training: Physical workers seek opportunities for skill development and training to adapt to changing technologies and practices in the green construction sector. They may desire access to educational programs and vocational training to enhance their expertise and employability.

2. Recognition and Respect: Physical workers aspire to be recognized and respected for their contributions to green cities and neighborhoods. They want their skills and efforts in building sustainable infrastructure and maintaining green spaces to be acknowledged and valued by society.

3. Career Advancement and Growth: Physical workers may have aspirations for career advancement within the green construction sector. They desire opportunities for growth, such as promotions, leadership roles, or entrepreneurship, to improve their socio-economic status and professional satisfaction.

Understanding and addressing these automatic and reflective needs of physical workers in the context of green cities is crucial for creating inclusive, sustainable, and equitable urban environments. It requires collaboration between stakeholders, including policymakers, employers, trade unions, and communities, to ensure that the motivations and aspirations of physical workers are adequately met.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or Green Building neighborhoods (GBN), physical workers have several opportunities, both physical and social:

1. Physical Opportunities:
   a. Employment in Green Industries: The development and maintenance of green cities and GBNs require physical workers for tasks such as construction, installation of green infrastructure (e.g., solar panels, green roofs), and landscaping. This creates employment opportunities for physical workers in sectors that prioritize sustainability and environmental conservation.
   b. Skill Enhancement: The transition towards green cities and GBNs necessitates upskilling and reskilling of the workforce. Physical workers have the opportunity to learn new techniques and acquire knowledge in sustainable construction practices, renewable energy systems, and green technologies. This can improve their employability and career prospects.

2. Social Opportunities:
   a. Collaboration with Diverse Stakeholders: Physical workers in green cities and GBNs have the opportunity to collaborate with diverse stakeholders, including architects, urban planners, and environmental experts. This collaboration can lead to the exchange of knowledge and ideas, resulting in improved project outcomes and innovation.
   b. Community Engagement: Green cities and GBNs often emphasize community participation and engagement. Physical workers can contribute to community development initiatives, such as building community gardens, constructing sustainable public spaces, and implementing energy-efficient systems. This involvement fosters social cohesion and a sense of ownership and pride among physical workers and the broader community.

It is important to note that these opportunities may vary depending on the specific context and level of development of green cities and GBNs. Nonetheless, by leveraging their physical skills and expertise, physical workers can contribute significantly to the creation and maintenance of sustainable and resilient urban environments.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, the abilities or capabilities of physical workers can be categorized into physical and psychological aspects.

1. Physical Abilities:
- Physical Strength: Physical workers require a certain level of physical strength and endurance to carry out their tasks effectively. This includes activities such as lifting heavy objects, operating machinery, and engaging in manual labor.
- Stamina: Physical workers need to have the stamina to sustain physical exertion throughout their work shifts, as their roles often involve continuous physical activity.
- Dexterity: Certain occupations require physical workers to possess fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination for tasks that involve intricate movements or precise manipulations.
- Adaptability: Physical workers should be adaptable to various working conditions and environments, as they may need to work outdoors, in confined spaces, or at different heights.

2. Psychological Abilities:
- Resilience: Physical workers may face challenging working conditions, including exposure to extreme weather conditions, noise, dust, or hazardous materials. They need to have psychological resilience to cope with these stressors and maintain their mental well-being.
- Problem Solving: Physical workers may encounter unexpected challenges or obstacles during their work. They should have problem-solving skills to find practical and efficient solutions in a dynamic work environment.
- Teamwork and Communication: Physical workers often collaborate with other team members or interact with stakeholders such as architects, engineers, or supervisors. Effective communication and teamwork skills are essential for coordination and ensuring smooth workflows.
- Attention to Safety: Given the potential occupational hazards in physical work, workers should exhibit a heightened sense of safety awareness, attentiveness, and adherence to safety protocols to minimize risks.

These abilities and capabilities of physical workers in green cities are crucial for their effective and efficient engagement in sustainable construction practices, maintaining green infrastructure, and promoting sustainable transportation systems.
