# Local communication experts

## Description

Local communication experts are individuals who possess a deep understanding of the local context, culture, and communication channels within a specific urban area or neighborhood. These experts are well-versed in the use of various communication technologies, such as radio and social media, to effectively disseminate information related to public health emergencies, including contagious diseases. They play a crucial role in ensuring that clear and reliable information about the disease and control measures reaches the local population. Additionally, local communication experts are adept at facilitating two-way dialogue, such as Q&A sessions with experts, to address community concerns and provide accurate information. They are instrumental in publicizing different communication channels and groups, ensuring that vulnerable groups, including the elderly and disabled, are well-informed and connected to essential resources and support systems.

Moreover, local communication experts are pivotal in establishing focal points for case identification and reporting, social protection, and general information dissemination within the community. They work closely with local governments, humanitarian agencies, and NGOs to ensure that information on how to join these groups, seek advice, or request help is widely accessible. Their expertise in navigating the local communication landscape enables them to tailor communication strategies to the specific needs and preferences of the community, thereby fostering trust and cooperation. Ultimately, local communication experts are essential in bridging the gap between health authorities and the local population, ensuring that critical information about contagious diseases is effectively communicated and understood within the urban context.
