# International urban institutions

## Description

International urban institutions refer to organizations, networks, or bodies that operate at a global or international level and are focused on addressing urban issues and challenges. These institutions often work to promote sustainable urban development, improve the quality of life in cities, and address issues related to public health, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability. Examples of international urban institutions include the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), and the International Federation of Biosafety Association (IFBA). These institutions play a crucial role in shaping policies, providing guidance, and facilitating collaboration between different countries and cities to address urban challenges, including those related to contagious diseases.

International urban institutions often work to develop and promote best practices, standards, and guidelines for urban planning, infrastructure development, and public health management in cities and urban areas. They also play a key role in advocating for the integration of health considerations into urban planning and development processes. These institutions facilitate knowledge sharing, capacity building, and technical assistance to support cities in addressing contagious diseases and other public health challenges. Additionally, they often work to foster collaboration and partnerships between different stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions, to promote sustainable and healthy urban environments.
