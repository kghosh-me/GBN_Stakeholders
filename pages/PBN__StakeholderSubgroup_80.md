# Visitors in indoor spaces

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "visitors in indoor spaces" refers to individuals who enter and occupy enclosed areas within buildings for various purposes. These visitors could include employees working in office spaces, customers in retail establishments, students in educational institutions, and individuals seeking medical care in healthcare facilities. The concept of visitors in indoor spaces is significant in the context of contagious diseases as it pertains to the potential for virus transmission within these enclosed environments. The movement and interactions of visitors within indoor spaces can impact the spread of contagious diseases, making it crucial to consider factors such as ventilation, spatial configuration, and occupancy density to mitigate the risk of transmission.

Furthermore, the behavior and activities of visitors in indoor spaces play a pivotal role in the transmission dynamics of contagious diseases. Interactions such as close proximity, surface contact, and shared facilities within indoor spaces can contribute to the spread of viruses. As a result, understanding the patterns of movement and social dynamics of visitors in indoor spaces is essential for designing and managing buildings and neighborhoods to minimize the risk of contagion. This includes considerations for building design, spatial layout, and operational protocols to promote safe and healthy environments for visitors while mitigating the potential for disease transmission.

## NOA

### Needs

nIn the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, visitors in indoor spaces have both automatic and reflective needs or motivations that can be identified using the NOA (Needs, Opportunities, Abilities) framework.

Automatic needs refer to the basic and immediate requirements that visitors have in indoor spaces. These needs include:

1. Safety and health: Visitors have a need for a safe and healthy environment that minimizes the risk of contagion and promotes overall well-being. This includes factors such as air quality, cleanliness, and sanitation in indoor spaces.

2. Comfort and convenience: Visitors seek comfort and convenience in indoor spaces, such as suitable temperature and lighting conditions, comfortable seating, and accessible facilities.

3. Functionality: Visitors have a need for indoor spaces that serve their intended purposes efficiently. This includes access to necessary amenities, appropriate room layouts, and adequate space for activities.

Reflective needs are more complex and long-term motivations that visitors have in green cities:

1. Sustainability: Visitors in indoor spaces have a growing concern for sustainable practices and environmentally friendly buildings. They seek spaces that promote energy efficiency, use renewable resources, and minimize waste generation.

2. Connection with nature: Visitors desire indoor spaces that integrate natural elements, such as access to natural light, greenery, and outdoor views. These elements contribute to psychological well-being and provide a connection with the natural environment.

3. Social interaction: Visitors have a need for indoor spaces that facilitate social interaction and community engagement. This includes common areas, meeting spaces, and opportunities for collaboration.

By understanding and addressing these needs and motivations, green cities can design and manage indoor spaces that prioritize sustainability, health, comfort, functionality, and social interaction to enhance the overall visitor experience while promoting a sustainable and healthy environment.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or GBNs, visitors in indoor spaces have various opportunities, both physical and social. 

Physical Opportunities:
1. Enhanced Indoor Air Quality: Green buildings and neighborhoods prioritize adequate ventilation and air filtration systems, providing visitors with opportunities for improved indoor air quality. This can help reduce the potential transmission of contagious diseases by removing airborne pollutants and pathogens.

2. Efficient Energy Use: GBNs often incorporate energy-efficient systems, such as smart lighting and heating/cooling systems, which contribute to a comfortable and sustainable indoor environment for visitors. These opportunities help create environments that are conducive to the well-being and health of individuals.

3. Access to Green Spaces: GBNs emphasize the presence of green spaces, such as parks, rooftop gardens, or indoor plantings. These areas provide opportunities for visitors to connect with nature, engage in physical activity, and promote overall well-being and mental health.

Social Opportunities:
1. Community Interaction: GBNs often foster a sense of community by creating shared spaces, such as community centers or gathering areas, where visitors can socialize, interact, and build relationships. This encourages a sense of belonging and supports social well-being.

2. Education and Awareness: GBNs offer opportunities for visitors to learn about sustainability and green practices through educational programs and initiatives. This can raise awareness about environmental issues, encourage sustainable behaviors, and empower individuals to make informed choices.

3. Collaborative Initiatives: GBNs often promote collaboration and engagement among visitors through community events, workshops, or collaborative projects. This enables individuals to actively participate in sustainable initiatives, fostering a sense of collective responsibility and creating a network for sharing knowledge and resources.

Overall, in green cities or GBNs, visitors in indoor spaces have opportunities to be part of a sustainable and healthy community, enjoy improved indoor environments, engage in social interactions, and contribute to environmental conservation efforts.

### Capabilities

In the context of visitors in indoor spaces in green cities or green building neighbourhoods, their abilities or capabilities can be categorized into physical and psychological aspects.

1. Physical Abilities:
   - Mobility: Visitors should have the physical ability to move within indoor spaces comfortably and without constraints. This includes being able to navigate through entrances, corridors, staircases, and other areas within buildings.
   - Endurance: Visitors should have sufficient physical stamina to endure prolonged periods of occupancy within indoor spaces, especially in places such as healthcare facilities or educational institutions where waiting times may be longer.
   - Sensory perception: Visitors should have normal or enhanced sensory abilities to perceive and react to environmental cues and amenities within indoor spaces. This includes being able to detect proper lighting, air quality, temperature, and acoustic conditions.
   - Manual dexterity: Visitors should possess the manual dexterity required to interact with various facilities and equipment within indoor spaces. This includes tasks such as operating doors, elevators, touchscreens, or using shared amenities.

2. Psychological Abilities:
   - Understanding: Visitors should have the cognitive ability to understand and follow the guidelines, protocols, and signage within indoor spaces related to safety, hygiene, and disease prevention.
   - Communication: Visitors should possess effective communication skills to interact with staff, other visitors, and potentially emergency services within indoor spaces. This includes the ability to convey their needs, ask for assistance, or report any concerns related to health and safety.
   - Adaptability: Visitors should have the psychological flexibility and adaptability to adjust to new or changing conditions within indoor spaces, especially in response to infection control measures or emergency situations.
   - Self-awareness: Visitors should have a certain level of self-awareness of their own health status and symptoms. This includes being conscious of the need to practice proper hygiene, report any symptoms, or take necessary precautions to minimize the risk of transmission.

These physical and psychological abilities of visitors play a crucial role in their interactions and behaviors within indoor spaces. Understanding and addressing these abilities can help in designing inclusive and user-friendly indoor environments that promote the wellbeing and safety of visitors in green cities or green building neighbourhoods.
