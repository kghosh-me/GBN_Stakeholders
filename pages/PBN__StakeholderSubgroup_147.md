# Immigrant population

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "immigrant population" refers to individuals who have moved from one country to another with the intention of settling in the new location. Immigrant populations often bring with them diverse cultural backgrounds, languages, and traditions, contributing to the social fabric and economic vitality of urban areas. However, immigrant populations may also face unique challenges, including access to healthcare, housing, and employment, which can impact their vulnerability to contagious diseases. Understanding the immigrant population within the context of urban health is crucial for developing inclusive and effective public health strategies that address the specific needs and circumstances of these communities.

Immigrant populations in urban areas can be particularly susceptible to contagious diseases due to factors such as overcrowded living conditions, limited access to healthcare, and language barriers that may hinder effective communication about health risks and preventive measures. Additionally, the mobility of immigrant populations, both within the city and through international travel, can influence the spread of contagious diseases. Therefore, urban planning and public health initiatives need to consider the unique dynamics of immigrant populations, including their settlement patterns, social networks, and interactions with the broader community. By recognizing the diverse needs and experiences of immigrant populations, cities can develop targeted interventions and policies that promote the health and well-being of all residents, contributing to the overall resilience and sustainability of urban environments.

## NOA

### Overview

The behaviors of immigrant populations in green cities are driven by a combination of their needs, opportunities, and capabilities. Their needs for safe and affordable housing, basic amenities, and sustainable transportation motivate them to seek out and engage with green building neighborhoods that can provide these resources. The opportunities presented by green cities, such as access to green spaces, cultural exchange, and skill development, inspire immigrant populations to participate in community activities, share their cultural backgrounds, and acquire new skills in sustainable industries. Furthermore, the capabilities of immigrant populations, both physical and psychological, empower them to actively contribute to the development and maintenance of green cities. Their physical abilities, such as technical expertise in green technologies, allow them to actively participate in green infrastructure projects. Additionally, their psychological abilities, including knowledge of sustainable living practices and resilience, enable them to adapt to and thrive in the green city context. By aligning their behaviors with their needs, taking advantage of opportunities, and leveraging their capabilities, immigrant populations can actively contribute to the sustainable development and well-being of green cities.

### Needs

In the context of green cities, immigrant populations have both automatic and reflective needs or motivations that can be identified within the NOA (Needs, Opportunities, Abilities) framework.

Automatic needs or motivations refer to the basic, physiological, and safety needs that immigrant populations may have in green cities. This includes access to safe and affordable housing in sustainable and energy-efficient buildings, as well as clean and healthy environments that promote well-being. Immigrant populations may also require access to basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and reliable energy services, which are essential for their daily living. Additionally, there is a need for affordable and sustainable transportation options that facilitate their mobility within the green city and minimize their environmental impact.

Reflective needs or motivations are related to higher-level needs such as belonging, social connections, and cultural identity in green cities. Immigrant populations often bring diverse cultural backgrounds and traditions, which contribute to the unique fabric of green building neighborhoods. Therefore, there is a need for inclusive and culturally sensitive urban planning and design that takes into account the cultural diversity of immigrant populations. This includes creating public spaces that encourage social interaction, promoting cultural events and celebrations that honor different traditions, and providing opportunities for immigrant populations to participate in decision-making processes related to urban governance.

Moreover, immigrant populations may have the reflective need for economic opportunities and employment in green cities. They may seek access to job training programs, entrepreneurial opportunities, and fair employment practices that promote equal access to green jobs and contribute to their economic integration.

Overall, the needs or motivations of immigrant populations in green cities encompass both the automatic need for basic resources and safety, as well as the reflective needs for social connection, cultural inclusion, and economic opportunities. Recognizing and addressing these needs is crucial for creating inclusive and sustainable green building neighborhoods that benefit both the immigrant populations and the broader community.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, immigrant populations have both physical and social opportunities.

Physical opportunities:
1. Access to Green Spaces: Green cities prioritize the creation of parks, gardens, and green spaces that enhance the quality of life for residents. Immigrant populations can benefit from these spaces by having access to recreational areas, promoting well-being and community cohesion.
2. Sustainable Transportation: Green cities often prioritize sustainable transportation options such as walking, biking, or public transit. These options can provide immigrants with affordable and accessible transportation methods, reducing their reliance on private vehicles.
3. Energy-efficient housing: Immigrant populations can benefit from energy-efficient housing in green buildings. These buildings are designed to minimize energy consumption, reducing utility costs and promoting sustainable living.

Social opportunities:
1. Cultural Exchange: Green cities often promote cultural diversity and inclusion, providing opportunities for immigrants to share their unique cultural backgrounds, traditions, and experiences with the broader community.
2. Social Integration: Sustainable neighborhoods prioritize social cohesion, fostering a sense of belonging and community among residents. Immigrants have the opportunity to connect with their neighbors and participate in community activities, enhancing their integration into society.
3. Skill Development: Green cities often offer training programs and employment opportunities in sustainable industries such as renewable energy and urban farming. Immigrants can access these programs and acquire new skills that can improve their employability and contribute to the local green economy.

Overall, the opportunities for immigrant populations in green cities include access to green spaces, sustainable transportation, energy-efficient housing, cultural exchange, social integration, and skill development. These opportunities promote their well-being, social inclusion, and economic empowerment within the context of a sustainable and resilient urban environment.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, the abilities or capabilities of immigrant populations can be defined in terms of their physical and psychological capacities to engage with and contribute to these environments. 

Physical abilities refer to the skills and resources that immigrants possess to actively participate in the development and maintenance of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods. This can include practical skills related to green technologies, such as energy-efficient building practices, waste management, and sustainable transportation options. Immigrants with backgrounds in construction, engineering, or related fields may have valuable technical expertise to contribute to green infrastructure projects. Additionally, physical abilities also encompass the physical labor necessary for activities like urban gardening, waste sorting, and community clean-ups.

Psychological abilities, on the other hand, refer to the cognitive and emotional capacities of immigrant populations to adapt to and thrive in green cities. This includes the knowledge, awareness, and attitudes towards sustainable living practices. Immigrants may come from diverse cultural backgrounds with different understandings of environmental stewardship and sustainability. They may also have unique perspectives on the relationship between people and nature, which can inform innovative approaches to green urban planning and design.

Furthermore, psychological abilities also encompass the psychological well-being and resilience of immigrant populations. The process of migration and settling in a new environment can be challenging, and psychological abilities play a crucial role in overcoming barriers and adapting to the green city context. This includes factors such as coping mechanisms, social support systems, and cultural resilience that contribute to the mental health and overall well-being of immigrant populations in green cities.

By recognizing and building upon the physical and psychological abilities of immigrant populations, green cities can promote inclusivity, diversity, and sustainable development. This can be achieved through programs that provide training and support for immigrants to engage in green initiatives, as well as initiatives that foster social cohesion, cultural exchange, and the active participation of immigrant communities in shaping the future of their neighborhoods.
