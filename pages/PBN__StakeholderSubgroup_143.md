## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, 'sports-related organizations' refer to entities that are involved in the promotion, organization, and management of sports activities within urban areas. These organizations can include sports clubs, community sports centers, and sports event management companies. Their primary focus is to provide opportunities for physical activity and sports participation to residents of urban areas, contributing to the overall health and well-being of the population. Sports-related organizations play a crucial role in creating and maintaining sports infrastructure, organizing sports events, and fostering a culture of active living within urban communities. Additionally, they often collaborate with local authorities and health organizations to promote public health initiatives and encourage physical activity as a means of disease prevention.

Furthermore, sports-related organizations are instrumental in leveraging technology and sustainable practices to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of sports activities in urban environments. They may utilize smart technologies to monitor and manage sports facilities, optimize energy consumption, and promote eco-friendly transportation options for sports enthusiasts. These organizations also contribute to the development of sustainable sports infrastructure, such as green sports facilities and environmentally conscious sports events. By integrating smart and sustainable practices into their operations, sports-related organizations aim to create healthier and more resilient urban environments while mitigating the risks associated with contagious diseases through the promotion of active lifestyles.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, sports-related organizations have several opportunities, both physical and social:

1. Physical opportunities:
   a. Access to sustainable sports facilities: Green cities emphasize the development of sustainable infrastructure, including sports facilities. Sports-related organizations have the opportunity to collaborate with city planners and developers to design and build eco-friendly sports facilities that prioritize energy efficiency, use renewable materials, and incorporate green technologies such as solar panels or rainwater harvesting systems.
   b. Integration of smart technologies: Green cities leverage smart technologies to enhance sustainability and efficiency. Sports-related organizations can take advantage of these technologies to monitor and manage sports facilities, optimize energy consumption, and reduce waste. For example, using sensors to control lighting and heating systems in sports facilities, or implementing smart irrigation systems for sports fields.
   c. Promotion of active transportation: Green cities emphasize reduced reliance on private vehicles and promote the use of sustainable transportation modes. Sports-related organizations can encourage active transportation options such as walking, cycling, or using electric vehicles to travel to and from sports facilities or sports events. This can be achieved through the development of proper infrastructure, such as bike lanes or pedestrian-friendly paths.

2. Social opportunities:
   a. Collaboration with community stakeholders: Green cities involve active engagement from various stakeholders, including residents, local authorities, and organizations. Sports-related organizations can collaborate with these stakeholders to develop and implement initiatives that promote physical activity, health, and well-being in the community. This collaboration can include organizing community sports events, partnering with local schools or businesses to offer sports programs, or involving residents in the decision-making processes related to sports infrastructure and programming.
   b. Health promotion and disease prevention: In green cities, there is a focus on promoting public health and preventing diseases.
