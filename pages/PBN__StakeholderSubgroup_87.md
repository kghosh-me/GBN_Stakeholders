# Facility maintenance team

## Description

In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighbourhoods, a facility maintenance team can be defined as a group of professionals responsible for ensuring the upkeep, functionality, and safety of various built environment structures and systems. This team typically includes individuals with expertise in engineering, architecture, public health, and environmental science, working together to maintain the health and safety of urban designs, facilities, and buildings. Their responsibilities may encompass tasks such as adjusting cleaning processes to match the specific needs of the situation, increasing the frequency of cleaning, restocking cleaning supplies, and ensuring the availability of essential hygiene items like hand soap, hand sanitizer, and tissues in public spaces. Additionally, the facility maintenance team may be involved in implementing design strategies aimed at reducing the transmission risk of contagious diseases within the built environment, such as the installation of touchless technologies, smart air quality control systems, and the development of specific measures for wastewater management to limit virus propagation at the household level.

Furthermore, the facility maintenance team plays a crucial role in coordinating with local community authorities and stakeholders to implement policies and measures aimed at mitigating the transmission of contagious diseases at the neighbourhood level. This may involve the development and enforcement of socio-economic policies, improvement of infrastructures, and increasing access to water facilities and healthcare services. The team's efforts are essential in ensuring that the built environment is equipped to address public health challenges, such as the spread of infectious diseases, by integrating sustainable and health-promoting design elements into urban spaces. Overall, the facility maintenance team is instrumental in maintaining the functionality and safety of the built environment while prioritizing the health and well-being of the community.
