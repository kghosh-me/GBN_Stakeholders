# Ride-sharing

## Description

Ride-sharing, also known as carpooling, refers to the practice of multiple individuals sharing a single vehicle for a particular journey, typically to and from similar destinations. This mode of transportation is often facilitated through digital platforms or mobile applications, allowing users to connect with others who are traveling in the same direction. Ride-sharing is considered a sustainable and efficient transportation option, as it helps reduce the number of vehicles on the road, thereby decreasing traffic congestion and lowering carbon emissions. It also promotes a sense of community and social interaction, as passengers share the travel experience and costs, making it a cost-effective alternative to private vehicle ownership. Additionally, ride-sharing can contribute to the decongestion of public transport systems, especially during peak hours, by providing an additional mode of transportation for commuters.

In the context of contagious diseases, ride-sharing presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it can be a viable option for individuals who want to minimize their exposure to crowded public transportation during a pandemic, as it allows for a more controlled and potentially less crowded travel experience. However, it also raises concerns about the potential spread of infectious diseases, as passengers are in close proximity to each other within the confined space of a vehicle. Therefore, ensuring proper hygiene and sanitation measures within ride-sharing vehicles becomes crucial to mitigate the risk of disease transmission. Additionally, the use of digital platforms for ride-sharing can play a role in contact tracing and monitoring potential exposure to contagious diseases, providing valuable data for public health authorities and policymakers.

### Needs

nIn the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, the needs or motivations of stakeholders for ride-sharing can be categorized into automatic and reflective needs.

Automatic needs refer to the immediate, instinctive motivations that individuals have. In the case of ride-sharing, the automatic needs of stakeholders in green cities can include:

1. Convenience and Accessibility: Stakeholders may require a convenient and accessible transportation option that allows them to travel easily within the city or neighborhood without relying solely on private vehicles or public transportation systems.

2. Cost Savings: Ride-sharing can provide an opportunity for stakeholders to save money on transportation costs, as they can share the expenses of the journey with others.

3. Time Efficiency: Stakeholders may value ride-sharing as a time-efficient option, especially during peak hours when congested traffic or crowded public transport systems can result in delays and inefficiencies.

Reflective needs, on the other hand, are higher-level motivations that individuals have, often driven by a sense of purpose or long-term goals. In the context of ride-sharing in green cities, reflective needs of stakeholders may include:

1. Environmental Conservation: Stakeholders may be motivated to use ride-sharing as an environmentally friendly transportation option that reduces carbon emissions, promotes sustainable practices, and contributes to the overall goal of creating green cities.

2. Community Engagement: Ride-sharing can provide stakeholders with an opportunity to engage with their community, foster social interactions, and build connections with others who share similar travel needs and destinations.

3. Health and Well-being: Stakeholders may be motivated to choose ride-sharing in order to improve their physical and mental well-being by reducing stress associated with driving or public transportation, and by contributing to a cleaner and less congested urban environment.

By catering to both automatic (e.g., convenience, cost savings) and reflective (e.g., environmental conservation, community engagement) needs of stakeholders, ride-sharing initiatives in green cities can effectively address the motivations and aspirations of the residents and help promote sustainable transportation practices.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods, ride-sharing presents several opportunities for both physical and social aspects. 

1. Physical Opportunities:
- Reduction in Traffic Congestion: Ride-sharing helps decrease the number of vehicles on the road by promoting shared transportation. This leads to reduced traffic congestion in green cities, improving the overall mobility and accessibility for residents.
- Lower Carbon Emissions: By reducing the number of vehicles on the road, ride-sharing contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promoting a cleaner and greener environment in green cities.
- Efficient Use of Resources: Sharing a single vehicle for a particular journey optimizes the utilization of resources, such as fuel and parking spaces, resulting in more efficient resource management within green cities.

2. Social Opportunities:
- Community Building: Ride-sharing fosters a sense of community and social interaction among passengers who share the travel experience. It can bring people from different backgrounds together and facilitate meaningful connections, contributing to the overall well-being and social fabric of green cities.
- Cost-Effectiveness: Ride-sharing offers a cost-effective alternative to private vehicle ownership. By sharing the travel costs, individuals can save money on transportation expenses, increasing their financial resilience and enabling them to allocate resources to other needs, such as supporting local businesses or investing in sustainable initiatives in green cities.
- Accessibility and Inclusivity: Ride-sharing can enhance accessibility for individuals who may not have access to private vehicles or face mobility constraints. It promotes inclusivity within green cities by providing transportation options for various population segments, including elderly individuals, people with disabilities, and those in low-income communities.

Overall, ride-sharing in green cities presents opportunities to enhance the physical infrastructure, reduce environmental impacts, and improve community connections, making it an integral part of sustainable and socially inclusive transportation systems.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities and sustainable neighborhoods, the abilities or capabilities of stakeholders in relation to ride-sharing can be defined both in terms of physical and psychological factors. 

Physical abilities: 
1. Access to reliable and affordable transportation: Stakeholders need to have access to functional transportation infrastructure and services to be able to engage in ride-sharing. This includes access to public transit systems, ride-sharing platforms, and proximity to pick-up and drop-off points.
2. Availability of suitable vehicles: Stakeholders should have access to vehicles that are suitable for ride-sharing, such as cars that are in good condition, fuel-efficient, and meet the required safety standards.
3. Proximity to shared destinations: Stakeholders should be located in close proximity to others who have similar travel destinations or routes, making it more convenient and viable to engage in ride-sharing.

Psychological abilities:
1. Willingness to adopt sustainable transportation practices: Stakeholders need to have a positive attitude and willingness to embrace sustainable transportation options, such as ride-sharing, as part of their daily routines.
2. Trust in ride-sharing services: Stakeholders should have confidence in the safety and reliability of ride-sharing services, as they are entrusting their travel experience to strangers or fellow passengers.
3. Social skills and communication: Stakeholders should possess effective communication skills to coordinate and interact with other riders during the ride-sharing process. This includes the ability to negotiate pick-up and drop-off points, discuss payment arrangements, and maintain a respectful and harmonious atmosphere during the journey.

It is important to note that the abilities or capabilities of stakeholders may vary among different individuals and communities within green cities. Factors such as age, income level, cultural norms, and personal preferences can influence their abilities and willingness to engage in ride-sharing. Therefore, it is essential to consider these diverse factors when promoting and implementing ride-sharing initiatives in green cities.
