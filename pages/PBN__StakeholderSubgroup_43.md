# International trade regulators

## Description

I don't have enough information to provide a specific definition of "International trade regulators" in the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods. This term could refer to government agencies or international organizations responsible for regulating and overseeing international trade activities, including the movement of goods and services across borders. In the context of contagious diseases, international trade regulators may play a role in implementing and enforcing regulations related to the import and export of goods that could potentially spread diseases, such as food products, medical supplies, or other items that may carry pathogens.

Furthermore, international trade regulators may also be involved in developing and implementing trade policies and agreements that have implications for public health and disease control. This could include measures to ensure the safety and quality of imported goods, as well as protocols for managing trade during disease outbreaks to prevent the spread of contagious diseases across borders. In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, international trade regulators may collaborate with local and national health authorities to establish guidelines and protocols for trade activities that minimize the risk of disease transmission and support public health efforts.
