# Public space managers

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, public space managers can be defined as professionals responsible for the planning, design, and management of open, accessible areas within urban environments. These individuals play a crucial role in ensuring that public spaces are safe, inclusive, and conducive to community well-being, especially in the face of contagious diseases. Public space managers are tasked with implementing measures to protect public health, such as promoting physical distancing, enhancing ventilation, and facilitating the use of open spaces for essential activities. They also work to create flexible and adaptable public spaces that can be repurposed to support essential sectors during health crises, such as transforming open areas into temporary healthcare facilities or food distribution centers. Additionally, public space managers collaborate with various stakeholders, including local authorities, health professionals, and community members, to develop strategies that balance the need for compact, sustainable urban environments with the imperative of safeguarding public health.

Furthermore, public space managers are responsible for ensuring that public spaces are informative nodes in the city, providing relevant information on prevention measures, safety procedures, and guidelines to the public. They also oversee the implementation of restrictions on shared facilities in public spaces to mitigate the transmission of contagious diseases. In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, public space managers are at the forefront of integrating health considerations into urban planning and design. They work to strike a balance between the benefits of compact, dense urban environments and the need for compartmentalization and separation of populations to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Ultimately, public space managers play a critical role in reimagining and redesigning public spaces to meet the evolving needs of communities in the face of health crises.
