# Cleaning personnel

## Description

In the context of smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "cleaning personnel" refers to individuals responsible for maintaining the cleanliness and hygiene of various built environments, such as residential buildings, commercial spaces, and public facilities. These individuals are tasked with the regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, common areas, and facilities to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Cleaning personnel play a crucial role in ensuring that the built environment remains safe and healthy for occupants by implementing proper sanitation practices and adhering to cleaning protocols. Their responsibilities may include the use of cleaning supplies and equipment, waste management, and the implementation of specific cleaning procedures to address the unique challenges posed by contagious diseases.

Moreover, in the context of smart and sustainable cities, cleaning personnel may also be involved in the maintenance and operation of self-cleaning spaces and touchless technologies that contribute to reducing the transmission of viruses and other pathogens. As part of the broader efforts to promote public health and hygiene, cleaning personnel may work in coordination with building management, health authorities, and technology providers to implement innovative cleaning solutions that align with the principles of sustainability and smart urban design. Their role extends beyond traditional cleaning tasks to encompass the integration of technological advancements and sustainable practices aimed at creating healthier and more resilient built environments in the face of contagious diseases.

### Overview

The behaviors of cleaning personnel in green cities and green building neighborhoods (GBNs) are driven by a combination of their needs, opportunities, and capabilities. Their automatic needs for safety and health, a clean environment, and compliance with regulations motivate them to prioritize proper hygiene practices, use personal protective equipment, and follow cleaning protocols. Their reflective needs for environmental sustainability, knowledge and skill development, and recognition and appreciation drive them to adopt sustainable cleaning practices, seek ongoing training opportunities, and excel in their role. The physical opportunities provided by GBNs, such as working with self-cleaning technologies, adopting sustainable practices, and benefiting from enhanced safety measures, enable cleaning personnel to contribute to the overall goals of sustainability and health. The social opportunities of collaborating with stakeholders, receiving recognition and appreciation, and enhancing professional development further empower cleaning personnel to actively shape and contribute to the creation of healthier and more sustainable built environments. Their capabilities in terms of physical abilities, technical skills, adaptability, communication skills, attention to detail, and psychological resilience allow them to effectively carry out their responsibilities and align with the principles of sustainability and smart urban design. Overall, the behaviors of cleaning personnel are influenced by their needs, taken advantage of through opportunities, and enabled by their capabilities in the context of green cities and GBNs.

### Needs

In the context of green cities or Green Building neighborhoods (GBN), the cleaning personnel have both automatic and reflective needs or motivations.

Automatic needs refer to the basic, immediate, and essential requirements of cleaning personnel in their role within a GBN. These needs include:

1. Safety and health: Cleaning personnel need to ensure their own safety and health while carrying out their duties in GBNs. This includes following proper hygiene practices, using personal protective equipment (PPE), and receiving adequate training to prevent accidents and occupational hazards.

2. Clean and hygienic environment: Cleaning personnel have a strong motivation to maintain a clean and hygienic environment in GBNs. They strive to ensure that surfaces, common areas, and facilities are regularly cleaned and disinfected to prevent the spread of contagious diseases and maintain the well-being of occupants.

3. Compliance with regulations: Cleaning personnel need to adhere to regulations and standards set by local authorities and building management related to cleanliness, waste management, and sanitation practices. Compliance ensures that the GBN meets the required health and safety standards.

Reflective needs, on the other hand, are more long-term and reflective motivations that influence the behavior of cleaning personnel in the context of GBNs. These needs include:

1. Environmental sustainability: Cleaning personnel may have a motivation to contribute to the environmental sustainability goals of GBNs. They may seek to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, minimize water and energy consumption, and adopt waste management practices that prioritize recycling and waste reduction.

2. Knowledge and skill development: In the context of GBNs, cleaning personnel may have a need for ongoing training and professional development opportunities. They seek to acquire knowledge and skills related to sustainable cleaning practices, understanding the use of smart technologies, and staying updated with the latest advances in cleaning and maintenance techniques.

3. Recognition and appreciation: Cleaning personnel may have a reflective need for recognition and appreciation for their important role in maintaining the cleanliness and hygiene of GBNs. Acknowledgment from building management, residents, and other stakeholders can boost their morale and motivate them to perform at their best.

It is important for stakeholders involved in GBNs, such as building management and local authorities, to consider these needs and motivations of cleaning personnel to ensure their well-being, job satisfaction, and the effective implementation of sustainable and smart cleaning practices in GBNs.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities or Green Building neighbourhoods (GBN), cleaning personnel have various physical and social opportunities.

1. Physical Opportunities:
- Integration of Self-Cleaning Technologies: Cleaning personnel have the opportunity to work with and operate self-cleaning technologies and equipment that are increasingly being integrated into GBNs. These technologies, such as self-cleaning surfaces, robotic cleaners, and touchless systems, can make the cleaning process more efficient and reduce the transmission of pathogens.
- Sustainable Cleaning Practices: GBNs emphasize sustainable practices, including the use of eco-friendly cleaning products, waste management strategies, and energy-efficient cleaning equipment. Cleaning personnel have the opportunity to adopt these sustainable practices, contributing to the overall environmental goals of GBNs.
- Enhanced Safety Measures: GBNs often prioritize safety and health. Cleaning personnel can benefit from improved safety measures, such as proper training on handling hazardous materials, wearing protective gear, and following standardized cleaning protocols. These measures not only protect their health but also reflect the importance placed on their well-being in GBNs.

2. Social Opportunities:
- Collaboration with Stakeholders: Cleaning personnel can collaborate with various stakeholders involved in GBNs, such as building management, health authorities, technology providers, and residents. This collaboration allows them to exchange knowledge, share best practices, and contribute to the creation of healthier and more sustainable built environments.
- Recognition and Appreciation: In GBNs, there is often a greater appreciation for the role of cleaning personnel in ensuring the cleanliness, health, and well-being of occupants. Their contributions are valued and recognized, fostering a positive social environment where their work is appreciated.
- Professional Development: GBNs may present opportunities for cleaning personnel to enhance their professional skills and knowledge. They may receive training on the use of new technologies, sustainable cleaning practices, and other relevant areas, allowing for personal and career growth.

Overall, cleaning personnel in GBNs have the opportunity to be part of a larger movement towards sustainable and healthy urban environments. They can actively contribute to the implementation of innovative cleaning solutions, collaborate with stakeholders, and benefit from enhanced safety measures, thereby shaping the social and physical aspects of green cities.

### Capabilities
