# People with lower income

## Description

In the context of contagious diseases in smart and sustainable cities and neighborhoods, the term "people with lower income" refers to individuals or households who have limited financial resources and may struggle to afford basic necessities such as housing, healthcare, and nutritious food. These individuals often face challenges in accessing quality healthcare services, which can impact their ability to seek timely medical attention for contagious diseases. Additionally, people with lower income may be more likely to live in densely populated areas with inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, increasing their vulnerability to infectious diseases. Their living conditions, often characterized by overcrowding and limited ventilation, can contribute to a higher risk of disease transmission within their communities.

Furthermore, people with lower income may have limited access to information and resources for disease prevention and management. This can result in disparities in health outcomes, as they may face barriers to obtaining necessary medications, protective equipment, and healthcare guidance. Socioeconomic factors such as employment in essential service industries or informal work may also expose individuals with lower income to higher levels of contact with potential disease carriers, further increasing their risk of exposure. In the context of smart and sustainable cities, addressing the needs of people with lower income is crucial for promoting equitable access to healthcare, improving living conditions, and reducing the spread of contagious diseases within urban environments.

### Needs

nIn the context of green cities or green building neighborhoods (GBNs), people with lower income have specific needs or motivations, both automatic and reflective.

Automatic needs or motivations refer to the basic and immediate requirements for survival and well-being. For people with lower income in GBNs, their automatic needs may include:

1. Affordable Housing: Access to affordable, safe, and energy-efficient housing is a fundamental need for individuals with lower income. They require housing that is not only cost-effective but also incorporates eco-friendly and sustainable features to reduce utility costs and promote a healthier living environment.

2. Affordable and Nutritious Food: People with lower income may struggle with accessing nutritious food options due to limited financial resources. In GBNs, there is a need for affordable local food systems, such as urban farming or community gardens, that provide fresh and sustainable produce at a reduced cost.

3. Accessible Healthcare: Affordable and accessible healthcare services are crucial for people with lower income. GBNs should prioritize the establishment of healthcare facilities that cater to their specific needs, such as affordable clinics or mobile healthcare units.

Reflective needs or motivations pertain to higher-order desires related to personal growth, social inclusion, and community well-being. In GBNs, people with lower income may have the following reflective needs:

1. Education and Skill Development: Access to quality education and skill development opportunities can help individuals with lower income improve their employability and socioeconomic status. GBNs should provide educational institutions, vocational training centers, and programs that focus on green jobs and sustainable technologies.

2. Community Participation and Empowerment: People with lower income deserve opportunities to actively engage in decision-making processes, community development projects, and initiatives that promote their well-being. GBNs should facilitate community participation, social cohesion, and empowerment through inclusive governance structures and mechanisms for meaningful engagement.

3. Access to Green Spaces and Recreational Facilities: Green spaces and recreational facilities are essential for physical and mental well-being. GBNs should prioritize the creation of public parks, gardens, and leisure areas that are easily accessible to all residents, including those with lower income.

By addressing these automatic and reflective needs, GBNs can ensure that people with lower income can fully benefit from the sustainability measures and green infrastructure implemented in the neighborhood, leading to improved quality of life and overall well-being.

### Opportunities

In the context of green cities and green building neighborhoods (GBNs), people with lower income have both physical and social opportunities that can improve their living conditions and overall well-being. 

Physical opportunities in green cities include access to affordable and energy-efficient housing options. GBNs often prioritize sustainable building practices, which can lead to lower utility costs for residents. This can alleviate financial burdens for people with lower income and allow them to allocate their limited resources towards other needs. GBNs may also provide access to green spaces, parks, and recreational areas, promoting physical health and well-being.

Social opportunities in green cities include community engagement and empowerment. GBNs often involve residents in the design, planning, and decision-making processes, allowing them to have a voice in shaping their neighborhood. This involvement can foster a sense of ownership, pride, and social cohesion, improving social connections and support networks for people with lower income. Additionally, green cities often promote sustainable transportation options, such as public transportation, walking, and cycling, which can enhance social interactions by creating opportunities for community engagement during commutes.

Moreover, green cities often prioritize the development of social infrastructure, including healthcare facilities, educational institutions, and community centers. These resources can improve access to healthcare services, education, skill development, and social support for people with lower income. Inclusivity and affordability are key considerations in the planning and implementation of these social infrastructures, ensuring that they are accessible to all residents, regardless of their income level.

Overall, the opportunities in green cities for people with lower income revolve around providing affordable and energy-efficient housing, access to green spaces, involving them in decision-making processes, promoting sustainable transportation, and developing social infrastructure to enhance their access to essential services and social support. These opportunities aim to address their needs, improve their quality of life, and reduce disparities in access to resources and opportunities within the city.

### Capabilities

In the context of green cities and green building neighborhoods (GBN), the abilities or capabilities of people with lower income can be understood in terms of both physical and psychological factors.

Physical Abilities:
1. Adaptability: People with lower income often possess adaptability skills that enable them to cope with the challenges of living in resource-constrained environments. They may have experience in finding creative solutions to meet their needs with limited resources.
2. Physical Resilience: The physical abilities of individuals with lower income can be attributed to their ability to endure and adapt to harsh living conditions, including extreme weather events or limited access to infrastructure like water and sanitation systems.
3. Practical Skills: Many people with lower income have practical skills that can contribute to green cities and GBNs. These skills may include basic construction and repair abilities, gardening or agriculture knowledge, and waste management techniques.
4. Community Engagement: People with lower income often have strong community ties and a sense of belonging. They have the ability to mobilize and engage with fellow residents to collectively work towards sustainable and green initiatives in their neighborhoods.
   
Psychological Abilities:
1. Resilience: Individuals with lower income often develop psychological resilience due to their experiences of overcoming adversity. They have the ability to persevere and adapt to challenging circumstances and contribute positively to their living environment.
2. Creativity: The lack of financial resources may lead people with lower income to develop creative problem-solving skills. They can find innovative and low-cost solutions to improve their living conditions and contribute to the sustainable development of their neighborhoods.
3. Empathy and Collaboration: People with lower income often possess high levels of empathy and willingness to collaborate with others. They understand the importance of community support and collective action, making them valuable partners in implementing green initiatives and fostering a sense of community within GBNs.
4. Knowledge Sharing: Despite limited access to formal education, individuals with lower income often possess valuable knowledge and wisdom that can be shared with other residents and stakeholders in GBNs. Their experiential knowledge can contribute to sustainable practices and help bridge gaps in understanding among various community members.

Understanding these physical and psychological abilities of people with lower income is crucial in designing inclusive green cities and GBNs. By recognizing and valuing these abilities, stakeholders can empower individuals with lower income to actively participate in the decision-making processes, engage in sustainable practices, and contribute to the overall well-being of their communities.
