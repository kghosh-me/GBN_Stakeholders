### Overview

The behaviors of international financial institutions in green cities are driven by their needs for financial returns, risk mitigation, and market demand, as well as their reflective needs for environmental impact, sustainable development, and stakeholder engagement. These needs motivate them to seek projects that align with their goals of financial and environmental sustainability. Their capabilities, such as their financial capacity, technical expertise, and risk management skills, enable them to support and finance infrastructure development, promote technology adoption, contribute to urban planning and design, facilitate capacity building and knowledge sharing, and engage stakeholders effectively. By leveraging their capabilities, they are able to take advantage of the opportunities presented by green cities, both in terms of physical infrastructure development and social aspects. Consequently, their behaviors are aimed at advancing the transition towards sustainable and resilient communities while ensuring reasonable financial returns on their investments.

### Needs

International financial institutions, such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and European Investment Bank, have several needs or motivations when it comes to green cities or green building neighborhoods. These needs can be categorized into automatic and reflective needs.

Automatic Needs:
1. Financial Returns: International financial institutions have a need for financial returns on their investments in green cities. They seek projects that can generate adequate returns while also contributing to environmentally sustainable development.
2. Risk Mitigation: These institutions also have a need to mitigate risks associated with traditional investments in cities. Green cities offer an opportunity to diversify their portfolios and reduce exposure to climate-related risks.
3. Market Demand: There is a growing global market demand for sustainable cities and green building neighborhoods. International financial institutions recognize this need to align their investments with market trends and meet the demand for more environmentally friendly urban development.

Reflective Needs:
1. Environmental Impact: International financial institutions have a reflective need to support projects that have a positive environmental impact. They aim to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, promote renewable energy, and improve overall environmental quality.
2. Sustainable Development: The institutions also have a strong focus on promoting sustainable development. They seek projects that align with the principles of sustainable urban planning, including energy efficiency, waste management, sustainable transportation, and enhanced social inclusivity.
3. Stakeholder Engagement: International financial institutions recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement in green cities. They aim to support projects that involve a broad range of stakeholders, including local communities, government agencies, and private sector actors.

These needs of international financial institutions in green cities are driven by their desire for both financial sustainability and environmental sustainability. They aim to contribute to the transition towards more sustainable and resilient cities while ensuring a reasonable level of returns on their investments.
